<p>
Vespa provides metrics integration with CloudWatch, Datadog and Prometheus / Grafana,
as well as a JSON HTTP API.
See <a href="monitoring-with-grafana-quick-start.html">monitoring with Grafana quick start</a>
if you just want to get started monitoring your system.
</p>

<p>
There are two main approaches to transfer metrics to an external system:
<ul>
  <li>Have the external system <em>pull</em> metrics from Vespa</li>
  <li>Make Vespa <em>push</em> metrics to the external system</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pulling-metrics-from-vespa">Pulling metrics from Vespa</h2>
<p>
All pull-based solutions use Vespa's <a href="reference/metrics.html#metrics-api">metrics API</a>,
which provides metrics in JSON format, either for the full system or for a single node.
</p>
<table class="table">
<tr id="pulling-into-cloudwatch">
  <th>CloudWatch</th>
  <td><p>
    Metrics can be pulled into CloudWatch from both <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">Vespa Cloud</a> and self-hosted Vespa.
    The recommended solution is to use an AWS lambda function, as described in
    <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/metrics-emitter/tree/master/cloudwatch">
    Pulling Vespa metrics to Cloudwatch</a>.
  </p></td>
</tr><tr id="pulling-into-datadog">
  <th>Datadog</th>
  <td><p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This method currently works for self-hosted Vespa only.
    </p><p>
    The Vespa team has created a Datadog Agent integration
    to allow real-time monitoring of Vespa in Datadog.
    The <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/vespa/">Datadog Vespa</a> integration
    is not packaged with the agent, but is included in Datadog's
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras">integrations-extras</a> repository.
    Clone it and follow the steps in the
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/vespa/README.md">README</a>.
  </p></td>
</tr><tr id="pulling-into-prometheus">
  <th>Prometheus</th>
  <td><p>
    Vespa exposes metrics in a text based
    <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">format</a> that can be
    scraped by <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">Prometheus</a>.
    For Vespa Cloud, append <em>/prometheus/v1/values</em> to your endpoint URL.
    For self-hosted Vespa the URL is:
    <em>http://&lt;container-host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/prometheus/v1/values</em>, where
    the <em>port</em> is the same as for searching, e.g. 8080. Metrics for each individual host
    can also be retrieved at <code>http://host:19092/prometheus/v1/values</code>.
    </p><p>
    See the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quick-start</a> for a Prometheus / Grafana example.

<h2 id="pushing-metrics-to-cloudwatch">Pushing metrics to CloudWatch</h2>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This method currently works for self-hosted Vespa only.
</p><p>
This is presumably the most convenient way to monitor Vespa in CloudWatch.
Steps / requirements:
<ol>
  <li>An IAM user or IAM role that only has the <em>putMetricData</em> permission.</li>
  <li>Store the credentials for the above user or role in a
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/create-shared-credentials-file.html">
    shared credentials file</a> on each Vespa node.
    If a role is used, provide a mechanism to keep the credentials file updated when keys are rotated.</li>
  <li>Configure Vespa to push metrics to CloudWatch -
    example configuration for the <a href="reference/services-admin.html">admin</a> section in <em>services.xml</em>:
<pre>
&lt;metrics&gt;
    &lt;consumer id="my-cloudwatch"&gt;
      &lt;metric-set id="default" /&gt;
      &lt;cloudwatch region="us-east-1" namespace="my-vespa-metrics"&gt;
          &lt;shared-credentials file="/path/to/credentials-file" /&gt;
      &lt;/cloudwatch&gt;
    &lt;/consumer&gt;
&lt;/metrics&gt;
</pre>
    This configuration sends the default set of Vespa metrics to the CloudWatch namespace
    <code>my-vespa-metrics</code> in the <code>us-east-1</code> region.
    Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/vespa/metadata.csv">metric list</a>
    for <code>default</code> metric set.
</li>
</ol>
