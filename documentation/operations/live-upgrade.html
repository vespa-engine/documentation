<p>
This document describes how to live-upgrade a Vespa instance.
Use this procedure to upgrade without disruption to read or write traffic.
</p>
<ol>
  <li id="before-upgrading"><strong>Before upgrading</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If upgrading to a <strong>new major version</strong>,
        first upgrade to the latest version on the current major,
        then make sure there are no deprecation warnings when building and deploying the application
        <ul>
          <li>Also make sure to
            <a href="../reference/config-proxy.html#major-vespa-software-upgrade">detach</a>
            nodes as part of the procedure</li>
        </ul>
      </li><li>
        Redundancy: for data availability,
        there must be capacity to take one node per cluster out of service at the time.
        This procedure relies on that.
        If the clusters have redundancy=1, or searchable-copies=1,
        some data is not available (reduced coverage) during the upgrade
      </li><li>
        To reduce node downtime, download the new Vespa version to all hosts in advance
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-config-server"><strong>Upgrade config servers</strong>
    <ul><li>
      Install the new Vespa version on the config servers and restart them.
    </li><li>
      Redeploy and activate the application:
      <pre>$ <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-deploy">vespa-deploy</a> prepare &lt;app&gt; &amp;&amp; vespa-deploy activate</pre>
    </li></ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-all-other-nodes-one-by-one"><strong>Upgrade all other nodes one by one</strong>
    - for each of the other nodes in the system:
    <ul>
      <li>Stop Vespa services on the node</li>
      <li>Install the new Vespa version</li>
      <li>Start Vespa services on the node</li>
      <li>Wait until the node is fully up before doing the next node</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
