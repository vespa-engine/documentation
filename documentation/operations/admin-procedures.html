<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws.html">multinode install</a>
for a primer on how to set up a cluster. Required architecture is <em>x86_64</em>.
</p>



<h2 id="system-status">System status</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check <a href="../reference/logs.html">logs</a></li>
  <li>Use performance graphs, System Activity Report (<em>sar</em>)
    or <a href="#status-pages">status pages</a> to track load</li>
  <li>Use <a href="../reference/query-api-reference.html#tracelevel">query tracing</a></li>
  <li>Use <a href="../reference/services.html#clients">feed tracing</a></li>
    <!-- ToDo: this works? must document ... -->
  <li>Use the <em>cluster controller</em> status page (below)
    to track the status of search/storage nodes.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="process-pid-files">Process PID files</h2>
<p>
All Vespa processes have a PID file <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/run/{service name}.pid</em>,
where <em>{service name}</em> is the Vespa service name, e.g. <em>container</em> or <em>distributor</em>.
It is the same name which is used in the administration interface
in the <a href="../config-sentinel.html">config sentinel</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="status-pages">Status pages</h2>
<p>
Vespa service instances have status pages for debugging and testing.
Status pages are subject to change at any time -  take care when automating. Procedure
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Find the port:</strong>
    The status pages runs on ports assigned by Vespa. To find status page ports,
    use <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a>
    to list the services run in the application.
<pre>
$ vespa-model-inspect services
</pre>
    To find the status page port for a specific node for a specific service,
    pick the correct service and run:
<pre>
$ vespa-model-inspect service [Options] &lt;service-name&gt;
</pre>
  </li><li>
    <strong>Get the status and metrics:</strong>
    <em>distributor</em>, <em>storagenode</em>, <em>searchnode</em> and
    <em>container-clustercontroller</em> are content services with status pages.
    These ports are tagged HTTP. The cluster controller have multiple ports tagged HTTP,
    where the port tagged STATE is the one with the status page.
    Try connecting to the root at the port, or /state/v1/metrics.
    The <em>distributor</em> and <em>storagenode</em> status pages are available at <code>/</code>:
<pre>
  $ vespa-model-inspect service searchnode
  searchnode @ myhost.mydomain.com : search
  search/search/cluster.search/0
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19110 (STATUS ADMIN RTC RPC)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19111 (FS4)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19112 (TEST HACK SRMP)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19113 (ENGINES-PROVIDER RPC)
  <span style="background-color: yellow;">tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19114 (HEALTH JSON HTTP)</span>
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19114/state/v1/metrics
  ...
  $ vespa-model-inspect service distributor
  distributor @ myhost.mydomain.com : content
  search/distributor/0
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19116 (MESSAGING)
  tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19117 (STATUS RPC)
  <span style="background-color: yellow;">tcp/myhost.mydomain.com:19118 (STATE STATUS HTTP)</span>
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19118/state/v1/metrics
  ...
  $ curl http://myhost.mydomain.com:19118/
  ...
</pre>
    A status page for the cluster controller is available at the status port at
<code>http://hostname:port/clustercontroller-status/v1/<em>&lt;clustername&gt;</em></code>.
If <em>clustername</em> is not specified, the available clusters will be listed.
The cluster controller leader status page will show if any nodes are operating with differing cluster state versions.
It will also show how many data buckets are pending merging (document set reconciliation)
due to either missing or being out of sync.
<pre>
$ <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a> service container-clustercontroller | grep HTTP
</pre>
With multiple cluster controllers, look at the one with a "/0" suffix in its config ID;
it is the preferred leader.
</p><p>
The cluster state version is listed under the <em>SSV</em> table column.
Divergence here usually points to host or networking issues.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>



<h2 id="cluster-state">Cluster state</h2>
<p>
Cluster and node state information is available through the
<a href="../content/api-state-rest-api.html">State Rest API</a>.
This API can also be used to set a <em>user state</em> for a node - alternatively use:
<ul>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get-cluster-state">vespa-get-cluster-state</a></li>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-get-node-state">vespa-get-node-state</a></li>
  <li><a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-set-node-state">vespa-set-node-state</a></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Also see the cluster controller <a href="#status-pages">status page</a>.
</p><p>
Some state is persisted in a ZooKeeper cluster,
restarting/changing a cluster controller preserves this:
<ul>
  <li>The last cluster state version is stored, such that a cluster controller
      taking over can continue the version numbers where the old one left of</li>
  <li>The unit states (set by operators) are stored</li>
</ul>
In case of state data lost, the cluster state is reset - see
<a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller</a>
for implications.
</p>



<h2 id="cluster-controller-configuration">Cluster controller configuration</h2>
<p>
To configure the cluster controller, use
<a href="/documentation/reference/services-content.html#cluster-controller">services.xml</a>
and/or add
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/fleetcontroller.def">
configuration</a> under the <em>services</em> element - example:
<pre>
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;config name="vespa.config.content.fleetcontroller"&gt;
        &lt;min_time_between_new_systemstates&gt;5000&lt;/min_time_between_new_systemstates&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;
</pre>
</p>



<h2 id="Overload">Overload</h2>
<p>
Disk and/or memory might be exhausted and block feeding - recover from
<a href="../writing-to-vespa.html#feed-block">feed block</a>
</p><p>
Prioritized partition queues on the content nodes.
The metric to look out for is the <code>.filestor.alldisks.queuesize</code> metric,
giving a total value for all the partitions.
While queue size is the most dependable metric, operations can be queued elsewhere too,
which may be able to hide the issue.
There are some visitor related queues:
<code>.visitor.allthreads.queuesize</code> and <code>.visitor.cv_queuesize</code>.
</p><p>
Many applications built on Vespa is used by multiple clients
and faces the problem of protecting clients from abuse. Use the
<a href="http://javadoc.io/page/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/search/searchers/RateLimitingSearcher.html">
RateLimitingSearcher</a> to rate limit load from each client type.
</p><p>
Monitor CPU, memory and IO usage.
Note: A fully utilized resource does not necessarily indicate overload.
As the content cluster supports prioritized operations,
it will typically do as many low priority operations as it is able to
when no high priority operations are in the queue.
This means, that even if there's just a low priority reprocess
or a load rebalancing effort going on after a node went down,
the cluster may still use up all available resources to process these low priority tasks.
</p><p>
Track network bandwidth consumption and switch saturation.
</p>



<h2 id="monitor-distance-to-ideal-state">Monitor distance to ideal state</h2>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="../content/idealstate.html">distribution algorithm</a>.
Distributor <a href="#status-pages">status pages</a> can be viewed to manually inspect state metrics:
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>.idealstate.idealstate_diff</th><td>
        This metric tries to create a single value indicating distance to the ideal state.
        A value of zero indicates that the cluster is in the ideal state.
        Graphed values of this metric gives a good indication for how
        fast the cluster gets back to the ideal state after changes.
        Note that some issues may hide other issues, so sometimes the graph
        may appear to stand still or even go a bit up again, as resolving one
        issue may have detected one or several others.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.buckets_toofewcopies</th><td>
        Specifically lists how many buckets have too few copies.
        Compare to the <em>buckets</em> metric to see how big a portion of the cluster this is.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.buckets_toomanycopies</th><td>
        Specifically lists how many buckets have too many copies.
        Compare to the <em>buckets</em> metric to see how big a portion of the cluster this is.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.buckets</th><td>
        The total number of buckets managed. Used by other metrics reporting
        bucket counts to know how big a part of the cluster they relate to.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.buckets_notrusted</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets have no trusted copies.
        Without trusted buckets operations against the bucket may have poor performance,
        having to send requests to many copies to try and create consistent replies.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.delete_bucket.pending</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets that needs to be deleted.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets there are,
        where we suspect not all copies store identical document sets.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.split_bucket.pending</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets are currently being split.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.join_bucket.pending</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets are currently being joined.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>.idealstate.set_bucket_state.pending</th><td>
        Lists how many buckets are currently altered for active state.
        These are high priority requests which should finish fast,

<h3 id="add-or-remove-content-node">Add or remove content node</h3>
<p>
  An alternative to increasing cluster size is building a new cluster, then migrate documents to it.
  This is supported using <a href="../content/visiting.html#data-export-import">visiting</a>.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Node setup:</strong> Prepare nodes by installing software,
    set up the file systems / directories and set configuration server(s).
    <a href="../vespa-quick-start.html">Details</a>. Start the node.
  </li><li>
  <strong>Modify configuration:</strong>
  Add/remove a <a href="../reference/services-content.html#node">node</a>-element in <em>services.xml</em>
  and <a href="../reference/hosts.html">hosts.xml</a>.
  Refer to <a href="/documentation/vespa-quick-start-multinode-aws.html">multinode install</a>.
  It is key that the node's <em>distribution-key</em> is higher than the highest existing index.
</li><li>
  <strong>Deploy</strong>: <a href="#monitor-distance-to-ideal-state">
  Observe metrics</a> to track progress as the cluster redistributes documents.
  Use the <a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller</a>
  to monitor the state of the cluster.
</li><li>
  <strong>Tune performance:</strong> Use
  <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/storage/src/vespa/storage/config/stor-distributormanager.def">
    maxpendingidealstateoperations</a> to tune concurrency of bucket merge operations from distributor nodes.
  Likewise, tune <a href="../reference/services-content.html#merges">merges</a> -
  concurrent merge operations per content node. The tradeoff is speed of bucket replication vs
  use of resources, which impacts the applications' regular load.
</li><li>
  <strong>Finish:</strong> The cluster is done redistributing when <em>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</em>
  is zero on all distributors.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Do not remove more than <em>redundancy</em>-1 nodes at a time.
  Observe <em>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</em> to know bucket replica status,
  when zero on all distributor nodes, it is safe to remove more nodes.
  If <a href="../elastic-vespa.html#grouped-distribution">grouped distribution</a>
  is used to control bucket replicas, remove all nodes in a group
  if the redundancy settings ensure replicas in each group.
</p><p>
  To increase bucket redundancy level before taking nodes out,
  <a href="../content/content-nodes.html">retire</a> nodes.
  Again, track <em>idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</em> to know when done.
  Use the <a href="../content/api-state-rest-api.html">State API</a> or
  <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-set-node-state">vespa-set-node-state</a>
  to set a node to <em>retired</em>.
  The <a href="../content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster controller's</a>
  status page lists node states.
</p>


<h3 id="merge-content-clusters">Merge content clusters</h3>
<p>
  To merge two content clusters, add nodes to the cluster like <em>add node</em> above, considering:
<ul><li>
  <a href="../reference/services-content.html#node">distribution-keys</a> must be unique.
  Modify paths like <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/search/mycluster/n3</em> before adding the node.
</li><li>
  Set <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html">VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a>, then start the node.
</li></ul>
</p>


<h3 id="add-or-remove-services-on-a-node">Add or remove services on a node</h3>
<p>
It is possible to run multiple Vespa services on the same host.
If changing the services on a given host,
stop Vespa on the given host before running <code>vespa-deploy activate</code>.
This is because the services will be allocated port numbers depending on what is running on the host.
Consider if some of the services changed are used by services on other hosts.
In that case, restart services on those hosts too. Procedure:
<ol>
  <li>Edit <em>services.xml</em> and <em>hosts.xml</em></li>
  <li>Stop Vespa on the nodes that have changes</li>
  <li>Run <code>vespa-deploy prepare</code> and <code>vespa-deploy activate</code></li>
  <li>Start Vespa on the nodes that have changes</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3 id="add-remove-modify-chains">Add/remove/modify chains</h3>
<p>
Searcher, Document processing and Processing chains can be modified at runtime
without restarts.
Modification includes adding/removing processors in chains
and changing names of chains and processors.
Make the change and <a href="../cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploy">deploy</a>.
Some changes require a container restart, refer to
<a href="../document-processing.html#reconfiguring-document-processing">
reconfiguring document processing</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="restart-content-node">Configure grouped setup</h3>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="../performance/sizing-examples.html">sizing examples</a>
for changing from a flat to grouped cluster.
</p>


<h3 id="restart-distributor-node">Restart distributor node</h3>
<p>
When a distributor stops, it will try to respond to any pending cluster state request first.
New incoming requests after shutdown is commenced will fail immediately,
as the socket is no longer accepting requests.
Cluster controllers will thus detect processes stopping almost immediately.
</p><p>
The cluster state will be updated with the new state internally in the cluster controller.
Then the cluster controller will wait for maximum
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/fleetcontroller.def">
min_time_between_new_systemstates</a>
before publishing the new cluster state - this to reduce short-term state fluctuations.
</p><p>
The cluster controller has the option of setting states to make other
distributors take over ownership of buckets, or mask the change, making the
buckets owned by the distributor restarting unavailable for the time being.
Distributors restart fast, so the restarting distributor may transition
directly from up to initializing.
If it doesn't, current default behavior is to set it down immediately.
</p><p>
If transitioning directly from up to initializing, requests going through
the remaining distributors will be unaffected.
The requests going through the restarting distributor will immediately fail when it shuts down,
being resent automatically by the client.
The distributor typically restart within seconds,
and syncs up with the service layer nodes to get metadata on buckets it owns,
in which case it is ready to serve requests again.
</p><p>
If the distributor transitions from up to down, and then later to initializing,
other distributors will request metadata from the service layer node to take
over ownership of buckets previously owned by the restarting distributor.
Until the distributors have gathered this new metadata from all the service
layer nodes, requests for these buckets can not be served, and will fail back to client.
When the restarting node comes back up and is marked initializing or up in the cluster state again,
the additional nodes will dump knowledge of the extra buckets they previously acquired.
</p><p>
For requests with timeouts of several seconds,
the transition should be invisible due to automatic client resending.
Requests with a lower timeout might fail,
and it is up to the application whether to resend or handle failed requests.
</p><p>
Requests to buckets not owned by the restarting distributor will not be affected.
The other distributors will start to do some work though, affecting latency,
and distributors will refetch metadata for all buckets they own,
not just the additional buckets, which may cause some disturbance.
</p>


<h3 id="restart-content-node">Restart content node</h3>
<p>
When a content node restarts in a controlled fashion,
it marks itself in the stopping state and rejects new requests.
It will process its pending request queue before shutting down.
Consequently, client requests are typically unaffected by content node restarts.
The currently pending requests will typically be completed.
New copies of buckets will be created on other nodes, to store new requests in appropriate redundancy.
This happens whether node transitions through down or maintenance state.
The difference being that if transitioning through maintenance state,
the distributor will not start any effort of synchronizing new copies with existing copies.
They will just store the new requests until the maintenance node comes back up.
</p><p>
When coming back up, content nodes will start with gathering information
on what buckets it has data stored for.
While this is happening, the service layer will expose that it is initializing,
but not done with the bucket list stage.
During this time, the cluster controller will not mark it initializing in cluster state yet.
Once the service layer node knows what buckets it has,
it reports that it is calculating metadata for the buckets,
at which time the node may become visible as initializing in cluster state.
At this time it may start process requests,
but as bucket checksums have not been calculated for all buckets yet,
there will exist buckets where the distributor doesn't know if they are in sync with other copies or not.
</p><p>
The background load to calculate bucket checksums has low priority,
but load received will automatically create metadata for used buckets.
With an overloaded cluster, the initializing step may not finish before all buckets
have been initialized by requests.
With a cluster close to max capacity, initializing may take quite some time.
</p><p>
The cluster is mostly unaffected during restart.
During the initializing stage, bucket metadata is unknown.
Distributors will assume other copies are more appropriate for serving read requests.
If all copies of a bucket are in an initializing state at the same time,
read requests may be sent to a bucket copy that does not have the most updated state to process it.
</p>



<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>


<h3>Distributor or content node not existing</h3>
<p>
Content cluster nodes will register in the <em>vespa-slobrok</em> naming service on startup.
If the nodes have not been set up or fail to start required processes,
the naming service will mark them as unavailable.
</p><p>
<strong>Effect on cluster:</strong>
Calculations for how big percentage of a cluster that is available will
include these nodes even if they never have been seen.
If many nodes are configured, but not in fact available,
the cluster may set itself offline due by concluding too many nodes are down.
</p>


<h3>Content node not available on the network</h3>
<p>
vespa-slobrok requires nodes to ping it periodically.
If they stop sending pings, they will be set as down and the cluster will restore
full availability and redundancy by redistribution load and data to the rest of the nodes.
There is a time window where nodes may be unavailable but still not set down by slobrok.
</p><p>
<strong>Effect on cluster:</strong>
Nodes that become unavailable will be set as down after a few seconds.
Before that, document operations will fail and will need to be resent.
After the node is set down, full availability is restored.
Data redundancy will start to restore.
</p>


<h3 id="clean-mode">Clean mode</h3>
<p>
There has been rare occasions were we ended up with data that was internally inconsistent. This should be very rare
and has only happend once. For those circumstances it is possible to start the node in a special
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">validate_and_sanitize_docstore</a> mode.
This will do its best to clean up inconsistent data. However detecting that this is required is not an easy feat.
In order for this approach to work, all nodes must be stopped before enabling this feature.
If not the poison pill might come back as they have the same redundancy as the rest of your documents.
</p>


<h3>Distributor or content node crashing</h3>
<p>
A crashing node restarts in much the same node as a controlled restart.
A content node will not finish processing the currently pending requests,
causing failed requests.
Client resending might hide these failures,
as the distributor should be able to process the resent request quickly,
using other copies than the recently lost one.
</p>


<h3>Thrashing nodes</h3>
<p>
An example is OS disk using excessive amount of time to complete IO requests.
Eventually the maximum number of files are open, and as the OS is so dependent on the filesystem,
it ends up not being able to do much at all.
</p><p>
<em>get-node-state</em> requests from the cluster controller fetch node metrics from /proc
and write this to a temp directory on the disk before responding.
This causes a thrashing node to time out <em>get-node-state</em> requests,
setting the node down in the cluster state.
</p><p>
<strong>Effect on cluster:</strong>
This will have the same effects like the <em>not available on network</em> issue.
</p>


<h3>Constantly restarting distributor or service layer node</h3>
<p>
A broken node may end up with processes constantly restarting.
It may die during initialization due to accessing corrupt files,
or it may die when it starts receiving requests of a given type triggering a node local bug.
This is bad for distributor nodes,
as these restarts create constant ownership transfer between distributors,
causing windows where buckets are unavailable.
</p><p>
The cluster controller has functionality for detecting such nodes.
If a node restarts in a way that is not detected as a controlled shutdown, more than
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/fleetcontroller.def">
max_premature_crashes</a>,
the cluster controller will set the wanted state of this node to be down.
</p><p>
Detecting a controlled restart is currently a bit tricky.
A controlled restart is typically initiated by sending a TERM signal to the process.
Not having any other sign,
the content layer has to assume that all TERM signals are the cause of controlled shutdowns.
Thus, if the process keep being killed by kernel due to using too much memory,
this will look like controlled shutdowns to the content layer.

      When a document is removed, the document data is not immediately purged.
      Instead, <em>remove-entries</em> (tombstones of removed documents) are kept

      <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/searchcore/src/vespa/searchcore/config/proton.def">
        pruneremoveddocumentsage</a>.
      This ensures that removed documents stay removed in a distributed system where nodes change state.
      Entries are removed periodically after expiry.
      Hence, if a node comes back up after being down for more than two weeks,
      removed documents are available again, unless the data on the node is wiped first.
      A larger <em>pruneremoveddocumentsage</em> will hence grow the storage size as this keeps
      document and tombstones longer.
    </p><p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The backend does not store remove-entries for nonexistent documents.
      This to prevent clients sending wrong document identifiers from
      filling a cluster with invalid remove-entries.
      A side-effect is that if a problem has caused all replicas of a bucket to be unavailable,
      documents in this bucket cannot be marked removed until at least one replica is available again.
      Documents are written in new bucket replicas while the others are down -
      if these are removed, then older versions of these will not re-emerge,

      A cluster is typically sized to handle a given load.
      A given percentage of the cluster resources are required for normal operations,
      and the remainder is the available resources that can be used if some of the nodes are no longer usable.
      If the cluster loses enough nodes, it will be overloaded:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remaining nodes may create disk full situation.
          This will likely fail a lot of write operations, and if disk is shared with OS,
          it may also stop the node from functioning.</li>
        <li>Partition queues will grow to maximum size.
          As queues are processed in FIFO order, operations are likely to get long latencies.</li>
        <li>Many operations may time out while being processed,
          causing the operation to be resent, adding more load to the cluster.</li>
        <li>When new nodes are added, they cannot serve requests
          before data is moved to the new nodes from the already overloaded nodes.
          Moving data puts even more load on the existing nodes,
          and as moving data is typically not high priority this may never actually happen.</li>
      </ul>
