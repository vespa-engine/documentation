title: "Node and Network setup - Concepts and Requirements"
---

<p>
Vespa is composed of services that communicate and
interact with each other.  These services can be partitioned onto any
amount of actual hardware for scaling, or they can all coexist on a
single environment for development.  To achive this flexibility, some
requirements must be met for the environment where the services will
run.
</p>

<h2 id="node-concept">The node concept</h2>
<p>
A <em>node</em> in this context is the environment where some Vespa
services are running.  This can be an actual machine like a server in
a datacenter, or a laptop for developement and testing of Vespa
configuration.  It can also be a Virtual Machine or a Docker
container, so you can run multiple nodes on a single piece of
hardware.
</p>
<p>
The different Vespa services that run on nodes will mostly communicate
with each other via the network.  This means that all nodes must
have an IP address and have network connectivity to all other nodes.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are supported.  Note that the same
framework is used even when running the entire Vespa stack on a
single node.
</p>

<h2 id="network-name">The host name</h2>
<p>
In order to find the IP address of a node and connect to it, the
node must have a <em>host name</em> that identifies it and which
maps to its IP address.  Actual machines on a network will usually
have a <em>Fully Qualified Domain Name</em> (FQDN) in DNS which
should be used as the host name for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
Note that it is a <em>requirement</em> that the host name (configured
in <code>hosts.xml</code>) can be used to
look up the IP address of the node.  The configuration server use this
host name to construct URLs that will be used to open network
connections to Vespa services running on that node.  If your nodes use
IP addresses which don't have DNS names, you <em>must</em> have <em>all</em>
those IP addresses with corresponding host names in
<code>/etc/hosts</code> on <em>all</em> nodes in your Vespa installation.
We recommend that you use names that can be used as FQDNs also in
this case, in case you want to move to using a DNS server instead
of publishing the /etc/hosts file.
</p>

<h2 id="node-id">Identifying the node for configuration</h2>
<p>
When Vespa services are started on a node, the node must identify
itself to the configuration system to get the correct configuration
(including which services to run).  This requires a unique identifier
for the node in the config server.  Since it's already a requirement
that the node has a <em>host name</em> that the config server
must know, Vespa uses the same <em>host name</em> when a node
identifies itself to get its configuration.
</p>
<p>
This means that the node <em>must</em> know its own host name (FQDN),
and be in agreement with the config server about what exactly the host
name is.
</p>

<h2 id="find-hostname">Finding your own host name</h2>
<p>
As discussed above, a Vespa node needs to know its own host name when
it starts.  Usually this is achieved by just running
the <code>hostname</code> command.  If you can arrange so <code>hostname</code>
is set to the FQDN of the node, then everything should Just Work (TM).
</p>
<p>
But sometimes this doesn't work properly, either because that name
can't be used to find an IP address which works for connecting to
services running on the node, or it's just that the name doesn't agree
with what the config server thinks the node's host name is.  In this case
you can override by setting the <code>VESPA_HOSTNAME</code> environment variable,
then that will be used instead of running the <code>hostname</code> command.
</p>
</p>
Note that <code>VESPA_HOSTNAME</code> will be used <em>both</em>
when a node identifes itself to the config server <em>and</em> when a service
on that node registers a network connection point that other services can
connect to.
<p>


<h2 id="scenario-development">Simple single-node development environment</h2>
<p>
If you're just testing a Vespa configuration on
a single-node setup, you can usually avoid some setup hassle by
overriding the hostname with the value "localhost".  Try this command
for that purpose:
<br>
<code>echo "override VESPA_HOSTNAME localhost" >> /opt/vespa/conf/vespa/default-env.txt</code>
</p>
<p>
While the above should work for starting vespa services, running
Java unit tests won't pick up settings in <code>default-env.txt</code>
- you'll need to set the <code>VESPA_HOSTNAME</code> environment
variable directly.
</p>
