title: Tenants, Applications and Instances
---

<p>
  When registering for Vespa Cloud, a <em>tenant</em> is created.
  Tenant is the billable unit, and most often represents an organization.
  A tenant has one more more <em>applications</em> with one or more <em>instances</em>:

     alt="A tenant can have multiple applications with multiple instances each" />
<p>
  Instances are used for different use cases,
  and are deployed to a set of <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/zones">zones</a> - example:
</p>

     alt="An application can be deployed to multiple zones" />
<p>
  The <em>Application</em> has a "default" instance serving queries from two <em>production</em> zones.
  It has an "integration" instance with another dataset, used for other applications to interface a
  production-like, stable interface.
  Finally, a developer has deployed the "bob" instance to a <em>dev</em> zone to further develop plugin code.
</p>
<p>
  Deployments to production zones are specified in <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/deployment.html">deployment.xml</a>.
  Deployments to manual zones like <em>dev</em> and <em>perf</em>
  are normally done directly from a developer computer for rapid code and config development.
  Read more in <a href="automated-deployments.html">Automated deployments</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The service configuration is specified in <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/services.html">services.xml</a>
  and is composed of individually sized <em>clusters</em>.
  A cluster is deployed to a set of <em>nodes</em> with <em>resources</em> specified.
</p>



<h2 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
  The tenant name cannot be changed - create a new tenant, or contact Vespa Support.
</p>
<p>
  Tenants in trial are auto-expired once trial is completed.
  Move to a paid plan to keep applications and data.
</p>
<p>
  It is not possible to auto-migrate applications and data between tenants.
  To move an application to a new tenant, re-deploy the application with the new tenant name,
  see <a href="cloning-applications-and-data">cloning applications and data</a>.
