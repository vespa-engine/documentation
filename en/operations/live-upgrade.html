<p>
This document describes how to live upgrade a Vespa instance.
Use this procedure to upgrade without disruption to read or write traffic.
</p>
<ol>
  <li id="before-upgrading"><strong>Before upgrading</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If upgrading to a <strong>new major version</strong>:
        Upgrade to the latest version on the current major first, then read the release notes
        for the new major before progressing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Redundancy: For availability,
        there must be sufficient capacity to take one node per cluster out of service at the time.
        If the clusters have redundancy=1, or searchable-copies=1,
        some data will not be available during the upgrade (reduced coverage).
      </li>
      <li>
        To reduce node downtime, download the new Vespa version to all hosts in advance.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-config-server"><strong>Upgrade config servers</strong>
    <ul><li>
      Install the new Vespa version on the config servers and restart them one by one:
      Restart config server. Wait until it is up again, look in vespa log for
      "Changing health status code from 'initializing' to 'up'"
      or use <a href="configuration-server.html#troubleshooting">health checks</a>.
    </li><li>
      Redeploy and activate the application:
      <pre>$ <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-deploy">vespa-deploy</a> prepare &lt;app&gt; &amp;&amp; vespa-deploy activate</pre>
    </li><li>
      The other nodes in the system will not receive config until they are upgraded to the new version
      (there will be warnings in vespa log containing "Request callback failed: UNKNOWN_VESPA_VERSION"
      until the node is upgraded). This is to make sure that no new, possibly incompatible, config
      is served.
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li id="upgrade-all-other-nodes-one-by-one"><strong>Upgrade all other nodes one by one</strong>
    - for each of the other nodes in the system:
    <ul>
      <li>Stop Vespa services on the node
        <ul>
          <li>Consider running <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-proton-cmd">
          prepareRestart</a> to reduce start time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Install the new Vespa version</li>
      <li>Start Vespa services on the node</li>
      <li>Wait until the node is fully up before doing the next node -
        metrics/interfaces to be used to evaluate if the next node can be stopped:
        <ul>
            <li><em>.idealstate.merge_bucket.pending</em>:
              When 0, all buckets are in sync</li>
            <li>Check if a node is up using the
              <a href="../reference/metrics.html#state-v1-health">health API</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
