<h2 id="vespa-fbench">vespa-fbench</h2>
<p>
  <em>vespa-fbench</em> is used for benchmarking the capacity of a Vespa system.
  Refer to <a href="/en/performance/vespa-benchmarking.html">vespa-benchmarking</a>
  for usage and examples.
</p>
<p>
  Multiple hostnames and ports can be used,
  to distribute load round-robin to clients.
</p>
<p>Synopsis: <code>vespa-fbench [options] &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;port&gt;</code></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
$ vespa-fbench -n 10 -q query%03d.txt -s 300 -c 0 -o output%03d.txt -xy test.domain.com 8080

      It defines how often a client should perform a new request.
      However, a client may not perform another request before the result from the previous request has been obtained.

    <th>X percentile</th>
    <td>
      The X percentile of the response time samples;
      a value selected such that X percent of the response time samples are below this value.
      In order to calculate percentiles,
      a histogram of response times is maintained for each client at runtime and merged after the test run ends.
      If a percentile value exceeds the upper bound of this histogram,
      it will be approximated (and thus less accurate) and marked with '(approx)'.

      Note that if a request fails,
      the utilization will drop since the client has 'wasted' the time spent on the failed request.
