<p>
  A partial update is an update to one or more fields in a document.
  It also includes updating all index structures
  so the effect of the partial update is immediately observable in queries.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/attributes-update.svg" width="788px" height="auto"
     alt="Attribute is an in-memory data structure" />
<p>
  In Vespa, all fields can be partially updated by default.
  A field is index, attribute or summary or a combination of these,
  and both index and attribute fields can be queried.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <a href="proton.html#index">index</a> and summary fields,
    an update means a read-modify-write to the
    <a href="proton.html#document-store">document store</a>
    and limits throughput.</li>
  <li>Most <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> fields do not require the document store read-modify-write,
    increasing write throughput by orders of magnitude.</li>
  <li>The following attribute types still require the read-modify-write to the document store:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:array">array of struct</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:map">map of primitive and struct</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:predicate">predicate</a></li>
    <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:reference">reference</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Summary:</strong> For highest possible write throughput for field updates,
  use attributes to write at memory speed.
</p>
<p>
  Overview:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr><th>Field Setting</th><th>Searchable</th><th>Fast searchable</th><th>Matching</th><th>Ranking</th><th>Display in results</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>index</th><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Text and Exact matching</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>attribute</th><td>Y</td><td>Y with attribute:fast-search</td><td>Exact matching</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>summary</th><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Examples:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>
field user type string {
<span style="white-space: nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indexing: summary | index</span>
}
</pre>
    </td>
    <td>Summary + index field.
      The field is stored in the document store, a partial update to the field will trigger read + write.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<pre>
field user type string {
    indexing: attribute
}
</pre>
    </td>
    <td>Attribute only field.
      The field is stored in the attribute (in-memory) and a partial update will update the document in-place
      and will be visible for queries, ranking, grouping and sorting immediately.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>
  Partial updates have many use cases.
  <em>Functionally</em>, it enables updating a document without anything else than the ID,
  simplifying logic in the upper levels of the serving stack.
  <em>Performance-wise</em>, partial updates enables applications with a real-time update flow
  in tens of thousands updates per second. Examples
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr><th>Use case</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Filtering</th>
    <th>Inventory updates</th>
    <td>Update product price and inventory count in real time. Do not show items out of stock.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Update relations</th>
    <td>Add a "this person likes me" to the "likes me"
      <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weightedset">set</a> -
      display candidates based on sets of likes/dislikes/other relations.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ranking</th>
    <th></th>
    <td>Update click / views / non-clicks: Feed usage data to use in ranking - rank popular items higher.</td>
  </tr>
</table>



<h2 id="write-pipeline">Write pipeline</h2>
<p>
  Refer to <a href="proton.html">proton</a> for an overview of the write-pipeline
  and the Transaction Log Server (TLS).
  As updating means a document is already there, the Document Meta Store has an entry,
  so the FeedView needs to consider the field’s config for indexed, attribute and summary.
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr><th style="white-space:nowrap">Field Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>index</th><td>
    <p>
      For all <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#index">indexed fields</a>,
      a memory index is used for the recent changes, implemented using B-trees.
      This is periodically <a href="proton.html#memory-index-flush">flushed</a> to a disk-based posting list index.
      Disk-based indexes are subsequently <a href="proton.html#disk-index-fusion">merged</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating the in-memory B-trees is lock-free, implemented using copy-on-write semantics.
      This gives high performance, with a predictable steady-state CPU/memory use.
      The driver for this design is the requirement for a sustained, high change rate,
      with stable, predictable read latencies and small temporary increases in CPU/memory.
      This compared to index hierarchies, merging smaller real-time indices into larger, causing temporary hot-spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      When updating an indexed field, the document is read from the
      <a href="proton.html#document-store">document store</a>, the field is updated,
      and the full document is written back to the store.
      At this point, the change is searchable, and an ACK is returned to the client.
      Use <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> to avoid such document disk accesses
      and increase performance for partial updates.
      Find more details in <a href="performance/sizing-feeding.html">feed performance</a>.
    </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>attribute</th><td>
    <p>
    Attribute fields are in-memory fields, see <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.
    Updates are memory operations only.
    Persisted in TLS at write, and later flushed, see <a href="proton.html#attribute-flush">attribute-flush</a>.
    This makes updates inexpensive and fast.
    </p>
    <p>

    Note there is no transaction support. To support high rate, there is no coordination between threads - example:
    </p>
<pre>
{
    "update" : "id:namespace:doctype::1",
    "fields" : {
        "firstName" : { "assign" : "John" }
        "lastName"  : { "assign" : "Smith" }
    }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      Above, the attributes <em>firstName</em> and <em>LastName</em> are updated in the same operation from the client,
      whereas the update in the search core is non-transactional.
      This is a throughput vs consistency tradeoff that enables the extreme update rates
      without being a practical limitation for many applications.
      More details in <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating <a href="schemas.html#field">multivalue</a> attributes (arrays, maps, sets, tensors)
      means reading the current value, making the update and writing it back:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:array">Array of primitive types</a>,
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:weightedset">weightedsets</a> and
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:tensor">tensors</a> are in memory and therefore fast,
        see <a href="attributes.html#data-structures">attribute data structures</a> for performance considerations.</li>
      <li>If the attribute field is an <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:array">array of struct</a> or
        <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:map">map</a>,
        values are written in the document store and update rates are hence lower -
        refer to <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/issues/10892">
          #10892 <em>updates of array of map/struct</em></a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Query execution time can be improved by adding an in-memory B-tree posting list structure using
      <a href="performance/feature-tuning.html#when-to-use-fast-search-for-attribute-fields">fast-search</a>.
      This increases work when updating,
      as both the value and the posting list is updated and hence decreases update throughput.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="performance/sizing-feeding.html#attribute">sizing-feeding</a>
      for how to ensure an attribute is in memory on all nodes with a replica (searchable-copies or fast-access).
    </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>summary</th><td>
    <p>
      Refer to <a href="document-summaries.html">document summaries</a>.
      Need to document how an update to the summary store is.
      I think it is read the current version, modify and write back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attribute fields that are also in summary get their values from the memory structures, not the summary store.
      Use summary class with attributes only for applications with high write/query rates using memory only.
