  This article details the inner workings of Vespa Configuration.

</p>
<p>
  The problem of configuring nodes can be divided into three parts,
  each addressed by different solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Node system level configuration:</strong> Configure OS
  level settings such as time zone as well as user privileges on the node.</li>
  <li><strong>Package management</strong>: Ensure that the correct
  set of software packages is installed on the nodes.
  This functionality is provided by three tools working together.</li>
  <li><strong>Vespa configuration:</strong> Starts the configured
  set of processes on each node with their configured startup
  parameters and provides dynamic configuration to the modules run by these services.
  <em>Configuration</em> here is any data which:
  <ul>
    <li>can not be fixed at compile time</li>
    <li>is static most of the time</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that by these definitions, this allows all the nodes to
  have the same software packages (disregarding version differences, discussed later),
  as variations in what services are run on each node and in their behavior
  is achieved entirely by using Vespa Configuration.
  This allows managing the complexity of node variations completely
  within the configuration system, rather than across multiple systems.
</p>
<p>
  Configuring a system can be divided into:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Configuration assembly:</strong> Assembly of a complete
  set of configurations for delivery from the inputs provided by the
  parties involved in configuring the system</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration delivery:</strong> Definition of
  individual configurations, APIs for requesting and accessing
  configuration, and the mechanism for delivering configurations from
  their source to the receiving components</li>
 </ul>
<p>
  This division allows the problem of reliable configuration delivery in
  large distributed systems to be addressed in configuration delivery,
  while the complexities of assembling complete configurations
  can be treated as a vm-local design problem.
</p>
<p>
  An important feature of Vespa Configuration is the nature of the interface
  between the delivery and assembly subsystems.
  The assembly subsystem creates as output a (Java) object model of the distributed system.
  The delivery subsystem queries this model to obtain concrete configurations
  of all the components of the system.
  This allows the assembly subsystem to accept higher level, and simpler to use,
  abstractions as input and automatically derive detailed configurations with the correct interdependencies.
  This division insulates the external interface and the components being configured from changes in each other.
  In addition, the system model provides the home for logic
  implementing node/component instance variations of configuration.
</p>



<h2 id="configuration-assembly">Configuration assembly</h2>
<p>
  Config assembly is the process of turning the configuration input sources
  into an object model of the desired system,
  which can respond to queries for configs given a name and config id.
  Config assembly for Vespa systems can become complex,
  because it involves merging information owned by multiple parties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vespa operations</strong>
    own the nodes and controls assignment of nodes to services/applications</li>
  <li><strong>Vespa service providers</strong>
    own services which hosts multiple applications running on Vespa</li>
  <li><strong>Vespa applications</strong>
    define the final applications running on nodes and shared services</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The current config model assembly procedure uses a single source -
  the <a href="application-packages.html">application package</a>.
  The application package is a directory structure containing defined files
  and subdirectories which together completely defines the system -
  including which nodes belong in the system,
  which services they should run and the configuration of these services and their components.
  When the application deployer wants to change the application,
  <a href="application-packages.html#deploy">vespa-deploy prepare</a> is issued to a config server,
  with the application package as argument.
</p>
<p>
  At this point the system model is assembled and validated
  and any feedback is issued to the deployer.
  If the deployer decides to make the new configuration active,
  a <a href="application-packages.html#deploy">vespa-deploy activate</a> is then issued,
  causing the config server cluster to switch to the new system model
  and respond with new configs on any active subscriptions
  where the new system model caused the config to change.
  This ensures that subscribers gets new configs timely on changes,
  and that the changes propagated are the minimal set
  such that small changes to an application package
  causes correspondingly small changes to the system.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/config-assembly.svg" alt="The config server assembles app config" width="810px" height="auto" />
<p>
  The config model itself is pluggable, so that service providers may write
  plugins for assembling a particular service.
  The plugins are written in Java, and is installed together with the Vespa Configuration.
  Service plugins define their own syntax for specifying services
  that may be configured by Vespa applications.
  This allows the applications to be specified in an abstract manner,
  decoupled from the configuration that is delivered to the components.
</p>



<h2 id="configuration-delivery">Configuration delivery</h2>
<p>
  Configuration delivery encompasses the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Definition of configurations</li>
  <li>The component view (API) of configuration</li>
  <li>Configuration delivery mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>These aspects work together to realize the following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate inconsistency between code and configuration.</li>
  <li>Eliminate inconsistency between the desired configuration and the state on each node.</li>
  <li>Limit temporary inconsistencies after reconfiguration.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The next three subsections discusses the three aspects above,
  followed by subsections on two special concerns - bootstrapping and system upgrades.
</p>


<h3 id="configuration-definitions">Configuration definitions</h3>
<p>
  A <em>configuration</em> is a set of simple or array key-values with a name and a type,
  which can possibly be nested - example:
</p>
<pre>
myProperty "myvalue"
myArray[1]
myArray[0].key1 "someValue"
myArray[0].key2 1337
</pre>
<p>
  The <em>type definition</em> (or class) of a configuration object
  defines and documents the set of fields a configuration may contain
  with their types and default values.
  It has a name as well as a namespace.
  For example, the above config instance may have this definition:
</p>
<pre>
namespace=foo.bar

# Documentation of this key
myProperty string default="foo"

# etc.
myArray[].key1 string
myArray[].key2 int default=0
</pre>
<p>
An individual config typically contains a coherent set of settings regarding some topic,
such as <em>logging</em> or <em>indexing</em>.
A complete system consists of many instances of many config types.
</p>


<h3 id="component-view">Component view</h3>
<p>
  Individual components of a system consumes one or more such configs and
  use their values to influence their behavior.
  APIs are needed for <em>requesting</em> configs
  and for <em>accessing</em> the values of those configs as they are provided.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Access</em> to configs happens through a (Java or C++) class
  generated from the config definition file.
  This ensures that any inconsistency between the fields declared in a config type
  and the expectations of the code accessing it are caught at compile time.
  The config definition is best viewed as another class with an alternative
  form of source syntax belonging to the components consuming it.
  A Maven target is provided for generating such classes from config definition types.
</p>
<p>
  Components may use two different methods for <em>requesting</em> configurations
  (refer to <a href="contributing/configapi-dev-cpp.html">Config API</a> for C++ code):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Subscription:</strong> The component sets up
    <em>ConfigSubscriber</em>, then subscribes to one or more configs.
    This is the simple approach, there are <a href="contributing/configapi-dev-java.html">other ways of</a>
    getting configs too:
<pre>
ConfigSubscriber subscriber = new ConfigSubscriber();
ConfigHandle&lt;MydConfig&gt; handle = subscriber.subscribe(MyConfig.class, "myId");
if (!subscriber.nextConfig()) throw new RuntimeException("Config timed out.");
if (handle.isChanged()) {
  String message = handle.getConfig().myKey();
  # &hellip;consume the rest of this config
}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dependency injection:</strong> The component declares its
    config dependencies in the constructor and subscriptions are set up on its behalf.
    When changed configs are available a new instance of the component is created.
    The advantage of this method is that configs are immutable throughout the lifetime of the component
    such that no thread coordination is required.
    This method is currently only available in Java using the <a href="jdisc/index.html">Container</a>.
<pre>
public MyComponent(MyConfig config) {
  String myKey = config.myKey();
  # &hellip;consume the rest of this config
}
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For unit testing,
<a href="contributing/configapi-dev-java.html#unit-testing">configs can be created with Builders</a>,
submitted directly to components.
</p>


<h3 id="delivery-mechanism">Delivery mechanism</h3>
<p>
  The config delivery mechanism is responsible for ensuring that a new
  config instance is delivered to subscribing components,
  each time there is a change to the system model causing that config instance to change.
  A config subscription is identified by two parameters,
  the <em>config definition name and namespace</em>
  and the <a href="contributing/configapi-dev.html#config-id">config id</a>
  used to identify the particular component instance making the subscription.
</p>
<p>
  The in-process config library will forward these subscription requests to a node local
  <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/config-proxy.html">config proxy</a>,
  which provides caching and fan-in from processes to node.
  The proxy in turn issues these subscriptions to a node in the configuration server cluster,
  each of which hosts a copy of the system model and resolves config requests by querying the system model.
</p>
<p>
  To provide config server failover,
  the config subscriptions are implemented as long-timeout gets,
  which are immediately resent when they time out,
  but conceptually this is best understood as push subscriptions:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/config-delivery.svg" alt="Nodes get config from a config server cluster"
     width="795px" height="auto" />
<p>
As configs are not stored as files locally on the nodes,
there is no possibility of inconsistencies due to local edits,
or of nodes coming out of maintenance with a stale configuration.
As configuration changes are pushed as soon as the config server cluster allows,
time inconsistencies during reconfigurations are minimized,
although not avoided as there is no global transaction.
</p><p>
Application code and config is generally pulled from the config server -
it is however possible to use the <a href="reference/config-files.html#url">url</a>
config type to refer to any resource to download to nodes.
</p>


<h3 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h3>
<p>
Each Vespa node runs a <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/config-sentinel.html">config-sentinel</a> process
which start and maintains services run on a node.
</p>


<h3 id="upgrades">System upgrades</h3>
<p>
The configuration server will up/downgrade between config versions on the fly on minor upgrades
which causes discrepancies between the config definitions requested
from those produced by the configuration model.
Major upgrades, which involve incompatible changes to the configuration protocol or the system model,
require a <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/config-proxy.html">procedure</a>.
</p>

  <a href="contributing/configapi-dev.html">reference doc</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Vespa Configuration makes the following assumptions about the nodes using it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All nodes have the software packages needed to run the
    configuration system and any services which will be configured to run on the node.
    This usually means that all nodes have the same software,
    although this is not a requirement</li>
  <li>All nodes have <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/files-processes-and-ports.html#environment-variables">
    VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a> set</li>
  <li>All nodes know their fully qualified domain name</li>
  <li><a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/configuration-server.html">Configuration server operations</a>
    is a good resource for troubleshooting</li>
</ul>
