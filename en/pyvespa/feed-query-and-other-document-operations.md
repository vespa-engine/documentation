## Install pyvespa

```python
pip install pyvespa
```

## Define your application package

This tutorial assumes that a [Vespa application package](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-text-app.html) was defined and stored in the variable `app_package`. To illustrate this tutorial, we will use a basic question answering app from our gallery.


```python
from vespa.gallery import QuestionAnswering

app_package = QuestionAnswering()
```

## Deploy the application

It is required to deploy the application to follow the commands below.
Deploy the `app_package` using either [Docker](deploy-vespa-docker.html)
or [Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/getting-started-python).
The resulting Vespa connection should be stored in the `app` variable. For example, to deploy using Docker:


```python
import os
from vespa.deployment import VespaDocker

vespa_docker = VespaDocker(
    port=8081, 
    disk_folder=os.getenv("DISK_FOLDER") # requires absolute path
)
app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package)
```

## Sample data

Download sample data required to follow this guide.


```python
import json, requests

sentence_data = json.loads(
    requests.get("https://data.vespa.oath.cloud/blog/qa/sample_sentence_data_100.json").text
)
list(sentence_data[0].keys())
```




    ['text', 'dataset', 'questions', 'context_id', 'sentence_embedding']



## Feed data

Prepare the data as a list of dicts having the `id` key holding a unique id of the data point and the `fields` key holding a dict with the data fields required by the application.


```python
batch_feed = [
    {
        "id": idx, 
        "fields": sentence
    }
    for idx, sentence in enumerate(sentence_data)
]
```

Feed the batch to the desired schema, which in this case is the `sentence` schema.


```python
response = app.feed_batch(schema="sentence", batch=batch_feed)
```

## Query the application

We can query the application using the [Vespa Query Language](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-language.html).


```python
result = app.query(body={
  'yql': 'select text from sources sentence  where userQuery();',
  'query': 'What is in front of the Notre Dame Main Building?',
  'type': 'any',
  'hits': 5,
  'ranking.profile': 'bm25'
})
```


```python
result.hits[0]
```




    {'id': 'index:qa_content/0/a87ff679ab8603b42a4ffde2',
     'relevance': 11.194862200830393,
     'source': 'qa_content',
     'fields': {'text': 'Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend "Venite Ad Me Omnes".'}}



## Other document operations

### Get data

Get the sentences with ids = 0, 1 and 2.


```python
batch = [{"id": 0}, {"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]
response = app.get_batch(schema="sentence", batch=batch)
```

It is possible to inspect each of the Vespa responses through the `json` attribute. E.g. `response[0].json`.


```python
response
```




    [<vespa.io.VespaResponse at 0x121856f70>,
     <vespa.io.VespaResponse at 0x121c1dbb0>,
     <vespa.io.VespaResponse at 0x1218871c0>]



### Update data

To update a data point, it is required to inform the `id` of the data to be updated and the `fields` to be updated. Optionally, we can choose to `create` the data point if it does not exist.


```python
batch_update = [
    {
        "id": 0,                               # data_id
        "fields": {"text": "this is a test"},  # fields to be updated
        "create": False                        # Optional. Create data point if not exist, default to False.
        
    }
]
```


```python
response = app.update_batch(schema="sentence", batch=batch_update)
```

### Delete data

Delete the sentences with ids = 0, 1 and 2.


```python
batch = [{"id": 0}, {"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]
response = app.delete_batch(schema="sentence", batch=batch)
```
