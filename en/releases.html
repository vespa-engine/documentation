<p>
    Vespa is released every Monday through Thursday. Each public release has passed all
    functional and performance tests, and is already running the applications on our
    public cloud service.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    For each Vespa release, the following artifacts are provided:
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.yahoo.vespa/parent">Java artifacts for building Vespa applications on Maven Central</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/vespa/vespa/">Vespa RPMs on Fedora Copr</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vespaengine/vespa">Container images on Docker Hub</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>
<p>
    Vespa uses <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.
    Each release is backwards compatible and supports live migration on running systems, provided they
    are running a version which is less than 2 months old.
    It is therefore a minor version number change. All new features are released on such minor versions.
    Every second year or so we make a major version change which removes previously deprecated
    functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Java APIs, web service APIs and all application package constructs are supported through a major release
    and only removed on a new release if they are already marked deprecated.
</p>
<p>
    Use of deprecated Java APIs will cause a warning on compilation,
    and use of deprecated application package constructs will cause a deprecation warning on deployment.
    Note that Java APIs come in two categories:
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><em>Public APIs</em> carry the compatibility guarantee and are visible from your code
        as well as in the javadoc</li> <!-- ToDo javadoc - link to something here if possible -->
    <li><em>Exported APIs</em> are also visible from your code,
        but is not in the public Javadoc and carry no compatibility guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Check the Javadoc list to verify that you are using public packages.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, some public Java classes and methods are marked with the com.yahoo.api.annotations.Beta tag.
    These are under development and may still change before they stabilize.
</p>



<h2 id="stored-data">Stored Data</h2>

<p>
    Data written to Vespa is compatible between adjacent releases.
    For self-hosted systems, it may be necessary to upgrade through each
    minor release rather than in larger leaps to ensure Vespa can read existing data.
    This is a good practice in any case.
