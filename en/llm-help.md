title: "Getting help from LLMs"
---

This page describes some of the ways that you can get help from large language models (LLMs) when developing a Vespa application.
From our experience, providing the right context to the LLM is important to get good results when asking questions about Vespa.

## llms.txt

We provide an [llms.txt](../llms.txt) file, that can serve as a top level entrypoint for an LLM, which includes both top-level overview, architecture, as well as links and title to all documentation pages.

See [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) for more information about the format, and sample client.

## Markdown version of documentation pages

Every page of the documentation is available in markdown format, by changing the URL from `.html` to `.md`. 
There is also a link to the markdown version in the top right corner of each page.

## Search Vespa documentation tool

For humans, we have [search.vespa.ai](https://search.vespa.ai). LLMs can also use this through the API.
