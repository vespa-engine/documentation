<p>
  Using <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#reference">document references</a>,
  documents can have parent/child relationships.
  Use this to join data by <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#import-field">importing</a>
  fields from parent documents. Features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>simplify document operations - one write to update one value</li>
  <li>no de-normalization needed - simplifies data updates and atomic update into all children</li>
  <li>search child documents based on properties from parent documents</li>
  <li>search parent documents only</li>
  <li>use imported fields as part of <a href="visiting.html">visiting</a> and
    <a href="documents.html#document-expiry">garbage collection</a> with
    <a href="reference/document-select-language.html#using-imported-fields-in-selections">document
      selection</a> expressions</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Parent/child relationships are not supported in
  <a href="streaming-search.html#differences-in-streaming-search">streaming search</a>.
</p>
<p>
  An alternative to parent documents is using arrays or maps of struct fields - this guide covers both.
</p><p>
  Common use cases are applications with structured data like commerce (e.g. products with multiple sellers),
  advertising (advertisers with campaigns with ads, that have budgets that need realtime updates).
</p><p>

<h2 id="parent-documents">Parent documents</h2>
<p>
  Model parent-child relationships by using
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#reference">references</a>
  to <a href="reference/services-content.html#document">global documents</a>.
  This is like foreign keys in a relational database.
  Parents can have parents.
  A document can have references to multiple parents - the parents can be of same or different types.
</p><p>
  Using a <em>reference</em>, <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> fields can be
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#import-field">imported</a>
  from parent types into the child's <a href="schemas.html">schema</a>
  and used for matching, ranking, grouping and sorting.
  A reference is a special attribute with the parent's
  <a href="documents.html#document-ids">document ID</a> as value.
  References are hence weak:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>no cascade delete</li>
  <li>a referenced document can be non-existent - imported fields do not have values in this case</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When using parent-child relationships,
  data does not have to be denormalized as fields from parents are imported into children.
  Use this to update parent fields to limit number of updates if a field's value is shared between many documents.
  This also limits the resources (memory / disk) required to store and handle documents on content nodes.
</p><p>
  At cluster changes, global documents are merged to new nodes before regular documents.
  For consistency, a content node is not serving queries before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span>
  global documents are synchronized - refer to <a href="elasticity.html">content cluster elasticity</a>.
</p>
{% include important.html  content="
Cyclic or self <a href='reference/schema-reference.html#reference'>references</a> are not allowed."%}
<p>
  Performance notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>As parent documents are global,
    a write executes on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> content nodes -
    see <a href="performance/sizing-feeding.html#parent-child">examples</a></li>
  <li>Node capacity will limit the number of parent documents -
    there should normally be an order of magnitude fewer parent documents than child documents</li>
  <li>Memory usage grows accordingly. A global document is otherwise equal to a regular document,
    but each content node must be sized to hold all global documents plus its share of regular documents</li>
  <li>Reference fields add a memory indirection and does not impact query performance much</li>
  <li><a href="performance/feature-tuning.html#parent-child-and-search-performance">Search performance notes</a></li>
  <li><a href="partial-updates.html">Partial updates</a> to a reference field requires a read-modify-write to the
    document store and limits throughput.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="multivalue-fields">Multivalue fields</h2>
<p>
  A document can have <a href="schemas.html#document-fields">fields</a> that are arrays or maps of struct.
  Structs and documents are similar - a set of field name/value pairs.
  One-to-many mappings can therefore be implemented this way, as an alternative to using parent/child,
  when each document has a set of properties that belongs to that document.
</p><p>
  Refer to <a href="/en/searching-multi-valued-fields.html">multivalue fields</a> for more information.
</p>



<h2 id="parent-or-multivalue">Parent or multivalue?</h2>
<p>
  As a rule of thumb, model the items <em>searched for</em> as the document - example products for sale.
  Shared properties, like vendor, can be model using a parent document, importing a vendor name field -
  assuming a vendor has many products, and the vendor list is limited.
  Use arrays or maps of structs for properties documents might have, like shoe size or screen resolution -
  one can then have a struct field for property name and another for property value,
  giving a flexible structure for products with an unlimited set of possible properties.

<p>
  Document type <em>ad</em> has two references to <em>campaign</em>
  (via <em>campaign_ref</em> and <em>other_campaign_ref</em>)
  and one reference to <em>salesperson</em> (via <em>salesperson_ref</em>).
  The <em>budget</em> field from <em>campaign</em> is imported into the <em>ad</em> schema
  (via <em>campaign_ref</em>) and given the name <em>budget</em>.
  Similarly, the <em>name</em> of <em>salesperson</em> is imported as <em>salesperson_name</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Document type <em>campaign</em> has a reference to <em>advertiser</em>
  and imports the field <em>name</em> as <em>advertiser_name</em>.
  This is also imported into <em>ad</em> via <em>campaign_ref</em> from its grandparent <em>advertiser</em>.
  To use the imported fields in summary, define a document summary <em>my_summary</em> containing these fields.
