This document describes how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank">learning to rank</a>
or machine learned ranking (MLR) could be implemented with Vespa.
In this document we cover the following topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing and designing ranking features</li>
  <li>Gathering features as computed by Vespa</li>
  <li>Training a ranking model outside of Vespa using <a href="xgboost.html">XGBoost</a> with a GBDT model</li>
  <li>Representing the trained model in Vespa</li>
  <li>Evaluating the model in Vespa</li>
</ul>
<p>A few commonly used dataset and resources on MLR:</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="choosing-features">Choosing features</h2>
<p>
Vespa's <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank feature set</a>
contains a large set of low level features, as well as some higher level features.
Depending on the algorithm, it can be a good idea to leave out the un-normalized features
to avoid spending learning power on having to learn to normalize these features
and determine that they really represent the same information as some of the normalized features.
In various Learn to rank challenges one is given a fixed set of features,
e.g. in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mslr/">Microsoft Learning to Rank Datasets</a>
each document,query pair is represented by a 136 dimensional feature vector.
A few samples of features used in the mslr dataset:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature 1 : query term matches in body</li>
  <li>Feature 132 : QualityScore</li>
</ul>
<p>
With Vespa ranking framework you get to chose which features to use and also design your own features
on top of Vespa's rich set of built in <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank features</a>
and also <a href="tensor-user-guide.html">Vespa's tensor framework</a> for ranking.
</p>


<h3 id="custom-features">Custom features</h3>
<p>
When using machine learned ranking, we are searching a function space
which is much more limited than the space of functions supported by ranking expressions.
We can increase the space of functions available to MLR
because the primitive features used in MLR training do not need to be primitive features in Vespa -
they can just as well be ranking expression snippets.
If there are certain mathematical combinations of features believed to be useful in an application,
these can be calculated from the actual primitive features of Vespa
and given to the training as primitives.
Such primitives can then be replaced textually by the corresponding ranking expression snippet,
before the learned expression is deployed on Vespa.
</p><p>
Vespa supports <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#function-rank">expression functions</a>.
Functions having zero arguments can be used as summary- and rank-features.
Some examples of user defined features as functions:
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile training inherits default {
    function titlematch() {
      expression: fieldMatch(title).completeness * pow(0 - fieldMatch(title).earliness, 2)
    }
    function qualityScore() {
      expression: if(isNan(attribute(qualityScore)) == 1,0,attribute(qualityScore))
    }
    function realtimeCTR() {
      expression: if(isNan(attribute(ctr)) == 1,0,attribute(ctr))
    }
    function userInterestScore() {
      expression: sum(query(tensor)*attribute(tensor_attribute))
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above examples we have designed a title text matching feature using the built-int <em>fieldMatch(name)</em>.
In addition, there is a quality score feature which is reading a quality score from a
<a href="attributes.html">document attribute</a> (document feature only)
and also a <a href="tensor-user-guide.html#ranking-with-tensors">tensor dot product</a>
calculated between a query tensor and a document tensor.
</p>



<h2 id="collecting-features-for-training">Collecting Features for Training</h2>
<p>
After designing which features to use,
we need to have Vespa compute these features over the set of documents we have judgments for.
</p>
<p>
"All" ranking features can be included in the results for each document by adding
<code><a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.listFeatures">
ranking.listFeatures</a></code> to the query.
Since the set of actual feature computable are in general infinite,
"all" features really means a large default set.
If more rank features than is available in the default set is wanted,
they can be added to the set in the rank profile:
</p>
<pre>
rank-features {
    feature1
    feature2
}
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to take full control over which features will be dumped by adding</p>
<pre>
ignore-default-rank-features
</pre>
<p>
to the rank profile.
This will make the explicitly listed rank features the only ones dumped
when requesting rankfeatures in the query.
</p>
<p>
A simplified rank-profile with only a few custom feature functions is shown below.
We name this profile <em>training</em> and we inherit the default first phase expression of Vespa,
which is <a href="nativerank.html">nativeRank</a>:
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile training inherits default  {
    ignore-default-rank-features
    function averageTermSignificance() {
        expression:foreach(terms,N,term(N).significance,true,average)
    }

    function maxTermSignificance() {
        expression:foreach(terms,N,term(N).significance,true,max)
    }

    function averageTitleTermMatch() {
        expression:foreach(terms,N,fieldTermMatch(title,N).occurrences,true,average)
    }

    function averageDescriptionTermMatch() {
        expression:foreach(terms,N,fieldTermMatch(description,N).occurrences,true,average)
    }

    rank-features {
        rankingExpression(averageTermSignificance)
        rankingExpression(maxTermSignificance)
        rankingExpression(averageDescriptionTermMatch)
        rankingExpression(averageTitleTermMatch)

        nativeFieldMatch(title)
        nativeFieldMatch(description)
        nativeFieldMatch(brand)
        nativeProximity(title)
        nativeProximity(description)
        nativeProximity(brand)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
In this example there are four custom rank features (functions)
and six native Vespa <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank features</a>.
In this example there are no document only or query only features
which a real model probably would have had.
</p><p>
When you are lucky enough to have a training set containing judgments for certain documents,
it is useful to select those documents in the query
by adding a filter term matching the document id,
but without impacting the values of any rank features.
To do this, use the <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#recall">recall</a> parameter
to query for the document id which there exist a judgement for.
</p><p>
A <a href="query-api.html">query api request</a> example for a sample query
'hotels close to san jose airport' for a document with a <em>id</em> 8444.
The <em>docid</em> is a custom field defined in the schema file.
In this example use the rank profile <em>training</em> as defined above:
</p>
<pre>
{
    "yql" : "select rankfeatures from sources * where ({grammar: \"any\"}]userInput(@userQuery))",
    "userQuery": "hotels close to san jose airport",
    "recall:": "+id:8444",
    "hits": 1,
    "format": "json",
    "timeout": "5s",
    "ranking" : {
        "profile" : "training",
        "listFeatures": true
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
We limit the recall to the document id by the recall parameter. In the case where we have multiple judgements we can use OR syntax 
for the recall parameter:
<pre>
{
    "yql" : "select rankfeatures from sources * where ({grammar: \"any\"}]userInput(@userQuery))",
    "userQuery": "hotels close to san jose airport",
    "recall:": "+id:(8444 8321 8432)",
    "hits": 1,
    "format": "json",
    "timeout": "5s",
    "ranking" : {
        "profile" : "training",
        "listFeatures": true
    }
}
</pre>
  
Both cases select only rankfeatures field.
Notice the usage of <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#grammar">grammar</a> 'any' instead of the default 'and' mode
when parsing the user input query.
Vespa will return a response like this per hit:
</p>
<pre>
{ 
    "fields": {
        "rankfeatures": {
            nativeFieldMatch(brand): 0,
            nativeFieldMatch(description): 0.19769285365597042,
            nativeFieldMatch(title): 0.12901910388045487,
            nativeProximity(brand): 0
            nativeProximity(description): 0.0002378785403068704,
            nativeProximity(title): 0.03705999262914951,
            nativeRank(brand): 0,
            nativeRank(description): 0.08788992146268762,
            nativeRank(title): 0.06145960090566322,
            rankingExpression(averageDescriptionTermMatch): 0.875,
            rankingExpression(averageTermSignificance): 0.19415280564476844,
            rankingExpression(averageTitleTermMatch): 0.125,
            rankingExpression(maxTermSignificance): 0.6454215031943953
        }
    },
    "id": "index:mycontent/0/cfcd2084e4a5fe79265e37ad",
    "relevance": 0.1,
    "source": "mycontent"
}
</pre>
<p>
  Now we have one feature sample,
  but we need to repeat the above routine for all our documents where we have labels or judgments.
</p>



<h2 id="training-the-model">Training the Model</h2>
<p>
We now need to convert the feature data into a format read by MLR frameworks,
in this example we use <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">XGBoost</a>.
We need to map the feature names defined in the rank profile declared above into a format that XGBoost understands.
First we define a <em>featureMap.txt</em>:
</p>
<pre>
0   nativeFieldMatch(brand) q
1   nativeFieldMatch(description) q
2   nativeFieldMatch(title) q
3   nativeProximity(brand) q
4   nativeProximity(description) q
5   nativeProximity(title) q
6   nativeRank(brand) q
7   nativeRank(description) q
8   nativeRank(title) q
9   rankingExpression(averageDescriptionTermMatch) q
10  rankingExpression(averageTermSignificance) q,
11  rankingExpression(averageTitleTermMatch) q,
12  rankingExpression(maxTermSignificance) q
</pre>
<p>
The map defines the feature index (e.g 0) and the feature name.
Using the map and the scraped rankfeatures and the label (relevancy judgement) we can produce a training data set.
XGBoost accepts the <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/input_format.html">
LibSVM text vector representation</a>.
Given a relevancy judgment of 3.0 for the above sample document and our feature map definition,
our text vector becomes:
</p>
<pre>
3.0 0:0 1:0.19769285365597042 2:0.12901910388045487 3:0 4:0.0002378785403068704 5:0.03705999262914951 6:0 7:0.08788992146268762 8:0.06145960090566322 9:0.875 10:0.19415280564476844 11:0.125 12:0.6454215031943953
</pre>
<p>
With sufficient set of vectors set we can train a model.
In this example we use the <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/index.html">XGBoost python api</a>
and we have split the set of vectors into a training set <em>train.txt</em> and test set <em>test.txt</em>.
The feature map is saved in <em>feature-map.txt</em>.
Evaluation Methodology (Cross-Validation/Training set size/Test size etc.)
and XGBoost parameter tuning is out of scope for this document. Sample training snippet:
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from math import sqrt

dtrain = xgb.DMatrix('train.txt')
dtest = xgb.DMatrix('test.txt')
param = {'base_score':0,'max_depth':3, 'eta':0.5, 'objective':'reg:squarederror', 'eval_metric':'rmse'}
watchlist = [(dtest, 'eval'), (dtrain, 'train')]
num_round = 10
bst = xgb.train(param, dtrain, num_round, watchlist)
bst.dump_model("trained-model.json",fmap='feature-map.txt', with_stats=False, dump_format='json')
</pre>
<p>
We dump the trained model into <em>trained-model.json</em> and now the next step is to deploy this model file.
</p>



<h2 id="representing-the-model-in-vespa">Representing the model in Vespa</h2>
<p>
The above XGBoost model can be <a href="xgboost.html">represented in Vespa</a>
by adding a new rank profile which inherits from the <em>training</em> rank profile,
so that all our custom functions defined in the <em>training</em> rank profile is available for the evaluation:
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile evaluation inherits training {
    first-phase {
        expression:xgboost("trained-model.json")
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
After deploying the model,
we can search using it by choosing the rank profile in the search request <em>ranking.profile=evaluation</em>.
The above will evaluate the trained model for all matching documents which might be computationally expensive.
By using <a href="phased-ranking.html">phased ranking</a> we can use the trained model in a second phase expression
and a simplified expression in the first phase over all matching documents.
In the example we have used the two most important features
(as learned by XGBoost using the <em>get_fscore</em> api):
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile phased-evaluation inherits training {
    first-phase {
        expression: (180/225)*nativeRank(title) + (45/225)*nativeFieldMatch(description)
    }
    second-phase {
        expression:xgboost("trained-model.json")
    }
}
</pre>



<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  Some native features might be computationally expensive and some of sub-features like
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).earliness">fieldMatch(name).earliness</a>
  also requires full computation of all other sub-features of the
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).proximity">fieldMatch(name).proximity</a>.
  This is in general true for all native rank features of Vespa
</li><li>
  When collecting feature data from Vespa,
  it's important that the index has a representable corpus
  and not only limited to the documents there are judgments for.
  This ensures that corpus dependent features like
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#term(n).significance">term(n).significance</a>
  are comparable with the production size corpus.
  Vespa allows overriding any rank feature including <em>term(i).significance</em>
  using <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.features">ranking.features</a></li>
</ul>
