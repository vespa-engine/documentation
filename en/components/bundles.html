<p>
  The Container uses <a href="https://osgi.org">OSGi</a> to provide a modular platform
  for developing applications that can be composed of many reusable components.
  The user can deploy, upgrade and remove these components at runtime.
</p>



<h2 id="osgi">OSGi</h2>
<p>
  OSGi is a framework for modular development of Java applications, where a
  set of resources called <em>bundles</em> can be installed. OSGi allows the developer to
  control which resources (Java packages) in a bundle that should be available to
  other bundles. Hence, you can explicitly declare a bundle's public API,
  and also ensure that internal implementation details remain hidden.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you're already familiar with OSGi, we recommend reading Richard S. Hall's presentation
  <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/7956/Learning_to_ignore_OSGi.pdf">Learning
    to ignore OSGi</a>, which explains the most important aspects that you must relate to as a bundle
  developer. There are other good OSGi tutorials available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thiloshon.wordpress.com/2020/03/04/osgi-for-dummies/">OSGi for Dummies</a> </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/OSGi/article.html">OSGi Modularity and Services - Tutorial</a>
    (You can ignore the part about OSGi services.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  JDisc uses OSGi's <em>module</em> and <em>lifecycle</em> layers, and does not provide any functionality
  from the <em>service</em> layer.
</p>



<h2 id="osgi-bundles">OSGi bundles</h2>
<p>
  An OSGi bundle is a regular JAR file with a MANIFEST.MF file that describes its content,
  what the bundle requires (imports) from other bundles, and what it provides (exports) to other
  bundles. Below is an example of a typical bundle manifest with the most important headers:
</p>
<pre>
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.yahoo.helloworld
Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Export-Package: com.yahoo.helloworld;version="1.0.0"
Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version="1.3.0"
</pre>
<p>
  The meaning of the headers in this bundle manifest is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Bundle-SymbolicName</code> - The unique identifier of the bundle.</li>
  <li><code>Bundle-Description</code> - A human-readable description of the bundle's
    functionality.</li>
  <li><code>Bundle-Version</code> - Designates a version number to the
    bundle.</li>
  <li><code>Export-Package</code> - Expresses which Java packages contained
    in a bundle will be made available to the outside world.</li>
  <li><code>Import-Package</code> - Indicates which Java packages will be
    required from the outside world to fulfill the dependencies needed in a
    bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that OSGi has a strict definition of version numbers that need to
  be followed for bundles to work correctly.  See the
  <a href="https://docs.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/framework/Version.html#Version(java.lang.String)" data-proofer-ignore>OSGi
    javadoc</a> for details. As a general advice, never use more than three numbers
  in the version (major, minor, micro).
</p>



<h2 id="building-an-osgi-bundle">Building an OSGi bundle</h2>
<p>
  As long as the project was created by following steps in the
  <a href="../developer-guide.html">Developer Guide</a>,
  the code is already being packaged into an OSGi bundle by the
  <a href="#maven-bundle-plugin">Maven bundle plugin</a>.
  However, if migrating an existing Maven project, change the packaging statement to:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;packaging&gt;container-plugin&lt;/packaging&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  and add the plugin to the build instructions:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.yahoo.vespa&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;bundle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;!-- Find latest version at <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.yahoo.vespa%20a:bundle-plugin">search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.yahoo.vespa%20a:bundle-plugin</a> --&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{{site.variables.vespa_version}}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;failOnWarnings&gt;true&lt;/failOnWarnings&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Because OSGi introduces a different runtime environment from what Maven provides when running unit tests,
  one will not observe any loading and linking errors until trying to deploy the application onto a running Container.
  Errors triggered at this stage will be the likes of
  <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> and <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>.
  To debug these types of errors, inspect the stack traces in the
  <a href="../reference/logs.html">error log</a>, and refer to
  <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>.
</p><p>
  <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-logfmt">vespa-logfmt</a>
  with its <em>--nldequote</em> option is useful when reading logs.
</p>
<p>
  The test suite needs to cover deployment of the application bundle to
  ensure that its dynamic loading and linking issues are covered.
</p>



<h2 id="depending-on-non-osgi-ready-libraries">Depending on non-OSGi ready libraries</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately, many popular Java libraries have yet to be bundled with the
  appropriate manifest that makes them OSGi-compatible.
  The simplest solution to this is to set the scope of the problematic
  dependency to <strong>compile</strong> in your pom.xml file. This will cause the bundle
  plugin to package the whole library into your bundle's JAR file. Until the
  offending library becomes available as an OSGi bundle, it means that your
  bundle will be bigger (in number of bytes), and that classes of that
  library can not be shared across application bundles.
</p>
<p>
  The practical implication of this feature is that the bundle plugin
  copies the compile-scoped dependency, and its transitive dependencies,
  into the final JAR file, and adds
  a <code>Bundle-ClassPath</code> instruction to its manifest that
  references those dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  Although this approach works for most non-OSGi libraries, it only works for
  libraries where the jar file is <em>self contained</em>. If, on the other hand, the
  library depends on other installed files, it must be treated as if it was a
  <a href="#depending-on-JNI-libraries">JNI library</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="depending-on-JNI-libraries">Depending on JNI Libraries</h2>
<p>
  This section details alternatives for using native code in the container.
</p>


<h3 id="osgi-bundles-containing-native-code">OSGi bundles containing native code</h3>
<p>
  OSGi jars may contain .so files, which can be loaded in the standard way from Java
  code in the bundle. Note that since only one instance of an .so can be loaded at any time,
  it is not possible to hot swap a jar containing .so files - when such jars are changed
  the <a href="../jdisc/container-components.html#JNI-requires-restart">new configuration will not
  take effect until the container is restarted</a>.
  Therefore, it is often a good idea to package a .so file and its Java API
  into a separate bundle from the rest of your code to avoid having to restart the container on all code changes.
</p>


<h3 id="add-jni-code-to-global-classpath">Add JNI code to the global classpath</h3>
<p>
  When the JNI dependency cannot be packaged in a bundle,
  and you run on an environment where you can install files locally
  on the container nodes,
  you can add the dependency to the container's classpath and explicitly
  export the packages to make them visible to OSGi bundles.
</p>
<p>
  Add the following configuration in the top level <em>services</em>
  element in <a href="../reference/services-container.html">services.xml</a>:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;config name="search.config.qr-start"&gt;
        &lt;container&gt;
            &lt;classpath_extra&gt;/lib/jars/foo.jar:/path/bar.jar&lt;/classpath_extra&gt;
            &lt;export_packages&gt;com.foo,com.bar&lt;/export_packages&gt;
        &lt;/container&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;
    ...
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Adding the config at the top level ensures that it's applied to all jdisc clusters.
</p>
<p>
  The packages are now available and visible,
  but they must still be imported by the application bundle that uses the library.
  Here is how to configure the bundle plugin to enforce an import of the packages to the bundle:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.yahoo.vespa&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;bundle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;
  <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;configuration&gt;</span>
      <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;importPackage&gt;com.foo,com.bar&lt;/importPackage&gt;</span>
  <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;/configuration&gt;</span>
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  When adding a library to the classpath it becomes globally visible, and
  exempt from the package visibility management of OSGi.
  If another bundle contains the same library, there will be class loading issues.
</p>




<h2 id="maven-bundle-plugin">Maven bundle plugin</h2>
<p>
  The <em>bundle-plugin</em> is used to build and package components for the
  <a href="../jdisc/container-components.html">Vespa Container</a> with Maven.
  Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/multiple-bundles">
  multiple-bundles sample app</a> for a practical example.
</p><p>
  The minimal Maven <em>pom.xml</em> configuration is:

        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

<p>
  To create a deployable <a href="../application-packages.html">application package</a>, run:

<p>
  The bundle plugin automates generation of configuration classes by invoking the maven step
  <em>generate-resources</em> - read more in <a href="../configuring-components.html">
  configuring-components.html</a>
</p>


<h3 id="including-third-party-libraries">Including third-party libraries</h3>
<p>
  Include external dependencies into the bundle by specifying them as dependencies:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.httpcomponents.client5&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;httpclient5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  All packages in the library will then be available for use.
  If the external dependency is an OSGi bundle, one can deploy it
  instead of including it into the bundle by setting the scope to
  provided:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.httpcomponents.client5&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;httpclient5-osgi&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.0-beta2&lt;/version&gt;
    <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;</span>
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Then deploy the external dependency along with the bundle.
  Only packages exported by the author of the library will then be
  available for use (see the section below).
</p>


<h3 id="exporting-importing-and-including-packages-from-bundles">
  Exporting, Importing and Including Packages from Bundles</h3>
<p>
  OSGi features information hiding &mdash; by default all the classes
  used inside a bundle are invisible from the outside.  Also, the bundle
  will by default only see (all) the packages in the Java and Container
  + Vespa APIs. If any other package is needed by the bundle, then it
  must happen in one of three ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some additional packages are exported by the container and may
    be <em>imported</em> explicitly by a bundle</li>
  <li>In addition, any deployed bundle may export packages on its own,
    which may then be imported by another bundle</li>
  <li>Finally, the bundle may include its own JAR libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>
  One can export packages from a bundle by annotating the package.
  E.g. to export <em>com.mydomain.mypackage</em>, create <em>package-info.java</em>
  in the package directory with:
</p>
<pre>
@ExportPackage(version = @Version(major=1, minor=0, micro=0))
package com.mydomain.mypackage;

import com.yahoo.osgi.annotation.ExportPackage;
import com.yahoo.osgi.annotation.Version;
</pre>
<p>
  The Maven plugin will place such information in the manifest of the
  plugin JAR built to be picked up by the Container.
</p><p>
  Note that this may also be used with bundles that do not contain any
  searchers but libraries used by other searchers - a bundle may
  just exist to export some libraries and never have any searchers
  instantiated.
</p><p>
  Bundles may <em>import</em> packages (exported by some other bundle or
  by the container). The maven plugin will automatically import any
  package used from bundles it compiles against(i.e. maven dependencies
  with scope provided).
</p><p>
  As mentioned above, each exported package has a version associated
  with it. Similarly, an import of a package has a version range
  associated with it. The version range determines which exported
  packages can be used. The range used by the maven plugin is the
  current version(i.e. the version of the package available at compile
  time) up to the next major version (not including).
</p><p>
  To learn more about OSGi manifests and bundle packaging (e.g. how to
  include Java libraries and native code), please refer to the OSGi spec
  at <a href="https://osgi.org">the OSGi home page</a>.

  More details in <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>.

<h3 id="bundle-plugin-warnings">Bundle Plugin Warnings</h3>
<p>
    The bundle plugin issues warnings for the following common issues that may cause problems at runtime:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt><b><code>[WARNING] This project uses packages that are not part of Vespa's public api</code></b></dt>
    <dd>Vespa types that are not annotated with <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/annotations/latest/com/yahoo/api/annotations/PublicApi.html">@PublicApi</a>
        should not be used in application code, as these types are not guaranteed to be stable across Vespa releases.</dd>
    <dt><b><code>[WARNING] This project does not have 'container' as provided dependency</code></b></dt>
    <dd>All application bundles must have the <code>com.yahoo.vespa:container</code> artifact as a <em>provided</em> scoped dependency,
        to ensure that the generated 'Import-Package' OSGi header contains the Java packages provided by the Vespa runtime.</dd>
    <dt><b><code>[WARNING] This project defines packages that are also defined in provided scoped dependencies</code></b></dt>
    <dd>Overlapping Java packages between bundles will usually cause problems at runtime, because the OSGi framework will only be able
        to resolve classes from one of the bundles.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Make sure that the jar files (i.e. bundles) are actually deployed with correct names per <em>services.xml</em>.</p>


<h3 id="could-not-load-class">Could not load class</h3>
<p>
  If a component is added to services.xml, and its class cannot be found in the declared bundle,
  the container will fail to start. For example:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;component id="com.example.MissingClass" bundle="my-bundle" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The log will contain an error like this:
</p>
<pre>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not load class 'com.example.MissingClass' from bundle my-bundle
</pre>
<p>
  If you see this error, please make sure that the class actually exists in the given bundle. Also, verify that
  the <code>id</code> (or <code>class</code>) tag refers to the component class, and not e.g. a java package
  or the bundle name.
</p>


<h3 id="class-not-found">Class not found</h3>
<p>
  All classes that are referred to in a user bundle must either be embedded in the bundle,
  or imported from another bundle by an <code>Import-Package</code> statement in the bundle manifest.
  When this rule has been breached, we get one of the most commonly seen exceptions when working with OSGi bundles:
</p>
<pre>
...
exception=
    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/acme/utils/Helper
    ...
    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.acme.utils.Helper not found by my_bundle [29]
</pre>
<p>
  For the <a href="#maven-bundle-plugin">bundle-plugin</a> to automatically add an
  Import-Package statement to the bundle's manifest,
  that package must be exported from another bundle
  that is declared as a 'provided' scope dependency in <em>pom.xml</em>.
  If the dependency that contains the missing class is under your own control,
  make sure it's packaged as an OSGi bundle,
  and <a href="#exporting-importing-and-including-packages-from-bundles">export the package</a>
  from that bundle.
  If not, the simplest way to resolve the issue is to embed the dependency in your own bundle,
  by setting its scope to 'compile' instead of 'provided'.
</p><p>
  If the strategy above does not resolve the case,
  it's most likely because the class in question is loaded by reflection,
  e.g. <code>Class.forName("com.acme.utils.Helper")</code>.
  This is quite common when working with libraries for pluggable frameworks,
  for which there is a separate <a href="../jdisc/pluggable-frameworks.html">troubleshooting doc</a>.
  <!-- ToDo: Maybe that troubleshooting should be moved here, too? -->

<h3 id="slow-container-start">Slow Container start</h3>
<p>In the vespa log, a container startup looks like:</p>

  The container is ready at the last log line - note the long startup time.
  To get more details on what the container is doing at startup, inspect the ComponentGraph debug log.
  Find the container service name (here: "container"), set debug logging and restart the container:

<p>In this particular example, query profile compilation takes a long time.</p>


<h3 id="unresolved-constraint">Unresolved constraint</h3>
<p>
  If the bundle has an Import-Package for a package that is not available at runtime,
  the OSGi framework will report an unresolved constraint error.
  The symptom as seen in the log is:
</p>
<pre>
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Unresolved constraint in bundle my_bundle [29]:
Unable to resolve 29.0:
missing requirement [29.0] osgi.wiring.package; (osgi.wiring.package=<span class="pre-hilite">com.acme.utils</span>)
     at org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.resolveBundleRevision(Felix.java:3974)
</pre>
<p>
  This means that the missing class resides in a 'provided' dependency referred to from
  the bundle's <em>pom.xml</em>, either directly or transitively.
  In order to make the dependency available at runtime, there are two options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The easiest is to set the dependency as 'compile' scope (instead of 'provided') to embed it in your own bundle.
    This works fine in most cases, unless two of the dependencies need two different versions of the same library.
  </li>
  <li>Add the missing jar file to the <code>components/</code> folder of the application package,
    along with your own bundles.
    The maven-dependency-plugin has a goal called 'copy-dependencies' to help with this.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the missing jar is a transitive dependency, maven can help visualize the dependency graph of the project:</p>
<pre>
$ mvn dependency:tree
</pre>


<h3 id="multiple-implementations-of-the-same-class">Multiple implementations of the same class</h3>
<p>
  When two bundles interact via their public APIs, it is crucial that both bundles resolve
  each and every participating class to the same <code>Class</code> object.
  If not, we will get error messages like:
</p>
<pre>
java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving field
"DATETIME" the class loader (instance of
org/apache/felix/framework/BundleWiringImpl$BundleClassLoaderJava5) of the referring
class, javax/xml/datatype/DatatypeConstants, and the class loader (instance of
&lt;bootloader&gt;) for the field's resolved type, pe/DatatypeConstants, have different Class
objects for that type
</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre>
java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: loader (instance of &lt;bootloader&gt;)
previously initiated loading for a different type with name "<span class="pre-hilite">javax/xml/namespace/QName</span>"
</pre>
<p>or (less frequently):</p>
<pre>
java.lang.ClassCastException: com.acme.utils.Helper cannot be cast to  com.acme.utils.Helper
</pre>
<p>
  All these error messages indicate that multiple implementations of one or more classes are used at runtime -
  possible root causes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two interacting user bundles embed the same Java package.</li>
  <li>A user bundle embeds a Java package that is exported from one of the JDisc bundles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, the "duplicate" package is pulled in by the user bundle transitively from a library dependency.</p>


<h4 id="multiple-implementations-example">Multiple implementations example</h4>
<p>
  Let's take a look at an example resolving the duplicate <em>javax.xml.namespace.QName</em> class
  from the error message above.
</p><p>
  All 'javax.xml' packages in the JDK are exported by the JDisc core bundle.
  This means that they should be imported by user bundles, instead of embedded inside them.
  Hence, ensure that there are no classes from packages prefixed by 'javax.xml' in the bundle.
  Find out which library that pulls in the package:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Extract the full component jar, including any embedded jars.
    One tool that does the job is <a href="https://github.com/pojosontheweb/rjar/">rjar</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Search the folder where the jar was extracted for 'javax.xml' classes:</p>
    <pre>
$ find . | grep "javax/xml/.*\.class"

...
./my_bundle-deploy.jar/dependencies/<span class="pre-hilite">stax-api-1.0.1.jar</span>/javax/xml/namespace/QName.class
...
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Find out which libraries that pulled in the offending classes - here it was <code>stax-api-1.0.1</code>.
    Usually, these libraries are not pulled in by the pom as direct dependencies,
    but rather transitively via another library being used.
    Use maven's dependency plugin from the application directory to find the direct dependency:
    <pre>
$ mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose

[INFO] +- com.acme.utils:jersey-utils:1.0.0:compile
[INFO] |  +- com.sun.jersey:jersey-json:jar:1.13:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- org.codehaus.jettison:jettison:jar:1.1:compile
[INFO] |  |    \- <span class="pre-hilite">stax:stax-api:jar:1.0.1:compile</span>
</pre>
    <p>Observe that <code>stax:stax-api:1.0.1</code> is pulled in transitively from the direct
      dependency <code>com.acme.utils:jersey-utils</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To exclude <code>stax:stax-api</code>, add the appropriate
    <code>exclusion</code> from the direct dependency <code>com.acme.utils:jersey-utils</code> in <em>pom.xml</em>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.acme.utils&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-utils&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;exclusions&gt;</span>
        <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;exclusion&gt;</span>
            <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;groupId&gt;stax&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
            <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;artifactId&gt;stax-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
        <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;/exclusion&gt;</span>
    <span class="pre-hilite">&lt;/exclusions&gt;</span>
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


<h4 id="multiple-implementations-example-slf4j-api">Multiple implementations example slf4j-api</h4>
<p>
  This is similar to the previous example, but logging libraries are maybe the most common problem teams encounter.
  Here we will see the symptom, use dependency:tree and add an exclusion. The symptom:
</p>
<pre>
java.lang.RuntimeException: An exception occurred while
constructing 'com.acme.utils.Helper in acme-utils'
Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method
"<span class="pre-hilite">org.slf4j</span>.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.getLoggerFactory()Lorg/slf4j/ILoggerFactory;"
the class loader (instance of org/apache/felix/framework/BundleWiringImpl$BundleClassLoaderJava5) of the
current class, org/slf4j/LoggerFactory, and the class loader (instance of
sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader) for the method's defining class,
org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder, have different Class objects for the type
org/slf4j/ILoggerFactory used in the signature
at
org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory(LoggerFactory.java:299)
at
org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggerFactory.java:269)
</pre>
<p>Running <em>mvn dependency:tree</em> in the previous example gives:</p>
<pre>
[INFO] +- com.yahoo.vespa:container-dev:jar:5.28.29:provided
[INFO] |  +- com.yahoo.vespa:jdisc_core:jar:5.28.29:provided

...
[INFO] +- com.acme.utils:smartlib:jar:1.0.0:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.6.6:compile
</pre>
<p>
  See that slf4j-api is no longer provided from container-dev, which it should.
  To fix this, add an exclusion on the offender:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.acme.utils&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;smartlib&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
</pre>
<p>But it still does not work! And we can see why:</p>
<pre>
$ jar -tf mailsearch-docprocs-deploy.jar  | grep slf

  dependencies/slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar
</pre>
<p>Something still pulls in slf4j... Other candidates:</p>
<pre>
[INFO] \- com.yahoo.vespa:application:jar:5.28.29:test
...
[INFO]    +- com.yahoo.vespa:zkfacade:jar:5.28.29:test

...
[INFO]    |  +- (org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14:jar:1.7.5:test - omitted for duplicate)
</pre>
<p>
  Added the right excludes for application and used mvn dependency:tree and verified that all references were gone,
  except the ones for container-dev. Still found:
</p>
<pre>
$ jar -tf mailsearch-docprocs-deploy.jar  | grep slf
dependencies/slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar
</pre>
<p>One can make it work by managing this dependency explicitly - add this at POM top-level:</p>
<pre>
&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.7.5&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
</pre>
