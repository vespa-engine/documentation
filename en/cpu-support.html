<p>
For maximum performance, the current version of Vespa for x86_64 is compiled only for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)">Haswell (2013)</a> or later CPUs.
If trying to run on an older CPU, you will likely see error messages like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Problem running program /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-runserver => died with signal: illegal instruction (you probably have an older CPU than required)
</pre>

<p>or in older versions of Vespa, something like</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/bin/start-container.sh: line 67: 10 Illegal instruction /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-start-configserver
</pre>

<p>
If you would like to run Vespa on an older CPU, we provide a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vespaengine/vespa-generic-intel-x86_64/">generic x86 container image</a>.
This image is slower, receives less testing than the regular image, and is less frequently updated.
</p>

<p><strong>To start a Vespa Docker container using this image:</strong></p>
  <div class="pre-parent">
    <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker run --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-container \
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 19071:19071 \
  vespaengine/vespa-generic-intel-x86_64
</pre>
  </div>
</p>
