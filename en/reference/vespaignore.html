<p>
  When deploying an <a href="../application-packages.html">application
  package</a> with <a href="/en/vespa-cli.html">Vespa CLI</a>,
  a <code>.vespaignore</code> file (similar to <code>.gitignore</code>) can be
  added to the package to prevent specific files or path patterns from being
  included in the deployed package.
</p>
<p>
  Ignoring files is useful when the Vespa application directory contains files
  that are only used for development purposes, and are not directly referenced
  by the application.
</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>
  The <code>.vespaignore</code> file must be placed at the same level
  as <a href="services.html">services.xml</a>. Having
  multiple <code>.vespaignore</code> at different path levels is not supported.
</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>
  This is an example of a <code>.vespaignore</code> file that excludes files
  and directories rarely needed in an application package.
</p>
<pre>
# exclude hidden files and readme
.DS_Store
.gitignore
README.md

# exclude feed input
ext/

# exclude auxiliary scripts
*.py
*.sh
</pre>



<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>
  The <code>.vespaignore</code> format is a subset of
  the <code>.gitignore</code> format, where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are ignored and can be used for comments</li>
  <li>Each non-empty line specifies a path pattern to ignore</li>
  <li>Patterns are relative to <code>services.xml</code></li>
  <li>
    A pattern can be either a literal string,
    or a pattern string as consumed by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match">filepath.Match</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Lines ending with <code>/</code> always denote a directory, e.g. the pattern <code>foo/</code>
    will match the directory <code>foo</code> (and any files below),
    but not the file <code>foo</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Complex rules, such as negated patterns and recursive globbing (<code>**</code>) are not supported.</p>
