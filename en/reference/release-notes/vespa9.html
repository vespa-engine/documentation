<p>
  This document lists the changes between Vespa major versions 8 and 9.
  As documented in <a href="https://vespa.ai/releases#versions">Vespa versions</a>,
  new functionality in Vespa is introduced in minor versions,
  while major versions are used to mark releases breaking compatibility.
  As Vespa 9 does not introduce any new functionality,
  it is as safe and mature as the versions of Vespa 8 preceding it.
<!--  No further releases will be made of Vespa 8, except
      possible critical security fixes. -->
<p>
<p>  
  Note: This is work in progress, Vespa 9 is tentatively planned for
  release in Q1 2026.
</p>



<h2 id="compatibility-overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
  The compatibility breaking changes in Vespa 9 fall into these categories:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#changed-defaults">Changes to default behaviour</a></li>
  <li><a href="#application-package-changes">Application package structure and settings</a> -
    deprecated settings and constructs in e.g. <em>schemas</em> and <em>services.xml</em> are removed.</li>
  <li><a href="#java-api-changes">Java APIs</a> -
    deprecated APIs are removed or revoked from Vespa's
    <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/annotations/latest/com/yahoo/api/annotations/PublicApi.html">public API</a> surface.</li>
  <li><a href="#container-runtime">Container runtime environment</a> -
    incompatible changes to the Java build and runtime environments.</li>
  <li><a href="#removed-http-api-parameters">HTTP API changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#removed-command-line-tools">Removed command line tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="#removed-or-renamed-metrics">Removed or renamed metrics</a></li>
  <li><a href="#security">Security related changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#operating-system">Operating system support</a></li>
  <li><a href="#other-changes">Other changes</a>, not covered by any of the above categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To ensure their applications are compatible with Vespa 9, application owners must:
<ul>
  <li>Review the list of <a href="#changed-defaults">changes to defaults</a> and add the necessary options
    if you want to preserve behavior from Vespa 8.</li>
  <li>Make sure there are no deprecation warnings when compiling against Vespa 8.</li>
  <li>Review the <a href="#application-package-changes">application package changes</a> and make sure there
    are no deployment warnings when deploying on Vespa 8.</li>
  <li>Review the list of <a href="#removed-http-api-parameters">HTTP API changes</a> and update
    any clients of the application.</li>
  <li>Review the remaining sections of this document, and update the application and its environment accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Usage of deprecated Java APIs produce warnings during compilation, while <em>deployment warnings</em>
  are produced for application package deprecations and most changes to the container runtime environment.
  In hosted Vespa or Vespa Cloud, deployment warnings are shown in the application's console view.
  However, for other types of changes, there is no way to emit deprecation warnings,
  so these are only described in this document and other Vespa documentation.
</p>

<p>
  The following sections lists all the changes from Vespa 8 to Vespa 9 in detail.
</p>

<h2 id="changed-defaults">Changed defaults</h2>

<p>These changes may break clients, and impact both performance and user experience.
Applications that are in production and relies on these defaults should
make configuration changes to keep the existing behavior when upgrading to Vespa 8.
This can be done on Vespa 8, <i>before</i> upgrading -
using <a href="../../applications/testing.html#feature-switches-and-bucket-tests">bucket tests</a> can be useful.</p>

<p>
The following defaults have changed:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Change</th>
    <th>Configuration required to avoid change on Vespa 9</th>
  </tr>


</table>

  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h3 id="searchdefinitions-folder"><em>searchdefinitions/</em> folder support removed</h3>
<p>
  Schemas should now be placed in the <em>schemas/</em> folder.
</p>


<h2 id="java-api-changes">Java API changes</h2>

<h3 id="removed-java-packages">Removed Java packages</h3>

<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h3 id="removed-java-classes-and-methods">Removed Java Classes and methods</h3>

<p>
  Classes and methods that were marked as deprecated in Vespa 8 are removed.
  If deprecation warnings are emitted for Vespa APIs when building the application,
  these must be fixed before migrating to Vespa 9. The sections below contain only the
  most notable changes.
</p>

<p>
  The following classes are no longer public API and have been moved to Vespa internal packages:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Package</th><th>Class</th><th>Migration advice</th></tr></thead>
  <tr>
    <td>com.yahoo.search.predicate</td>
    <td><em>PredicateIndex</em> + related classes</td>
    <td>
      The Predicate Search Java Library is removed (<em>com.yahoo.vespa:predicate-search</em>).
      Use <a href="../../querying/predicate-fields.html">predicate fields</a> in Vespa instead.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The following methods are removed:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Migration advice</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h3 id="changed-java-apis">Breaking changes to Java APIs</h3>
<p>
  The Javadoc of the deprecated types/members should document the replacement API.
  The below list is not exhaustive - some smaller and trivial changes are not listed.
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Type(s)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h3 id="deprecated-java-apis">Deprecated Java APIs</h3>
<p>
  A few redundant APIs have been deprecated because they have replacements that
  provide the same, or better, functionality. We advise you switch to the
  replacement to reduce future maintenance cost.
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Type(s)</th><th>Replacement</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>




<h2 id="container-runtime">Container Runtime Environment</h2>


<h3 id="jdk-version">JDK version</h3>
<p>
  Vespa 9 upgrades the JDK version from 17 to 25. Java artifacts built against older JDK versions
  will still be compatible with Vespa 9 (JDK 25). The opposite will not be possible - Vespa 8
  (JDK 21) is not compatible with newer JVM byte code. It's possible though to use the
  <em>--release</em> option for <em>javac</em> to target an older JDK version.
</p>


<h3 id="provided-maven-artifacts">Changes to provided maven artifacts</h3>

<p>
The following Maven artifacts are no longer provided runtime to user application plugins by the Jdisc container:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead><tr><th>Artifact</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
Make sure your application OSGi bundle embeds the required artifacts from the above list.
An artifact can be embedded by adding it in scope <em>compile</em> to the <em>dependencies</em> section in pom.xml.
Typically, these artifacts have until now been used in scope <em>provided</em>.
Use <code>mvn dependency:tree</code> to check whether any of the listed artifacts are directly or transitively included
as dependencies.
</p>
<p>
As always, remove any dependencies that are not required by your project. Consult the Maven documentation on
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html#dependency-exclusions" data-proofer-ignore>
Dependency Exclusions</a> for how to remove a transitively included dependency.
</p>

An example adding <em>org.json:json</em> as a compile scoped dependency:
<pre>
&lt;dependencies&gt;
  ...
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.json&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;json&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;20211205&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
  ...
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</pre>
