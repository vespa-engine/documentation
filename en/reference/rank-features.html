<p>
This is the list of the rank features in Vespa.
These features are available during document ranking for combination into a complete rank score by a
<a href="ranking-expressions.html">ranking expression</a>.
The features are a combination of coarse grained features suitable for hand-written expressions,
and finer grained features suitable for machine learning.
</p><p>
See also <a href="../ranking.html">the overview of the ranking framework</a>, and
<a href="rank-feature-configuration.html">rank feature configuration parameters</a>.
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Types: All rank feature values are floats. Ints are converted to exact whole value floats.
    String values are converted to exact whole value floats using a hash function.
    String literals in rank expressions are converted using the same hash function,
    to enable equality tests on string values.
  </li><li>
    Features which are <em>normalized</em> are between 0 and 1, where 0 is always the minimum and 1 the maximum.
    Normalized features should normally be preferred because they are more easily combined by
    <a href="ranking-expressions.html">ranking expressions</a> into a complete normalized score.
  </li><li>
    A query may override <em>any</em> rank feature value by submitting that value as a feature with the query.
  </li><li>
    Some features have parameters. It is always allowed to quote parameters with <em>"</em>.
    Nested quotes are not allowed and must be escaped using <em>\</em>.
    Parameters that can be parsed as feature names may be left unquoted.
    Examples: <em>foo(bar(baz(5.5)))</em>, <em>foo("bar(\"baz(\\\"5.5\\\")\")")</em>, <em>foo("need quote")</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<tr id="term(n).significance"><td>term(<em>n</em>).significance</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td><p>
    A normalized number (between 0.0 and 1.0) describing the significance
    of the term; used as a multiplier or weighting factor by many other rank features.
    </p><p>
    This should ideally be set by a searcher in the container for global correctness
    as each node will estimate the significance values from the local corpus.
    <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/TaggableItem.html#setSignificance-double-">
    Query API for setting significance</a>
    </p><p>
    As a fallback, a significance based on Robertson-Sparck-Jones term
    weighting is used; it is logarithmic from 1.0 for very rare terms down
    to 0.5 for very common terms (those occurring in every document seen).
    </p><p>
    Note that "very rare" is defined as a frequency of 0.000001 or less.
    This is the term document frequency (how many documents contain the
    term out of all documents that can be observed), so you cannot get 1.0
    as the fallback until you actually have a large number of documents
    (minimum 1 million) in the same search process.

<strong>Field match features.</strong> These features provide a good measure of the degree
to which a query matches the text of a field, but are expensive to calculate and therefore
often only suitable for second-phase ranking.
See the <a href="string-segment-match.html">string segment match</a> document
for details on the algorithm computing this set.
Note that even using a fine grained sub features like fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).absoluteOccurrence
will have the same complexity and cost as using the general top level fieldMatch(<em>name</em>) feature.

    If all the query terms were matched, this is 1.
    If no terms were matched, or these matches has weight zero this is 0.
    </p><p>
    As the sum of this number over all the terms of the query is always 1, sums over all fields of
    normalized rank features for each field multiplied by this number
    for the same field will produce a normalized number.

    similarity measures (similarity measures are combined the same way as
    the default output of the <code>textSimilarity</code> feature)
    multiplied with the element weight. This is a very flexible feature;
    how sub-scores are combined for each element and how element scores
    are aggregated may be configured. You may also add additional outputs

      The sparse dot product of the vector represented by the given weighted set attribute and
      the vector sent down with the query.
      </p><p>
      You can also do an ordinary full dotproduct by using arrays
      instead of weighted sets. This will be a lot faster when you have full vectors in the document with
      more than 5-10% non-zero values. You are also then not limited to integer weights. All the numeric
      datatypes can be used with arrays so you have full floating point support. The 32 bit floating point type
      yields the fastest execution.
      <ul>
        <li> <em>name</em>:   The name of the weighted set string/integer or array of numeric attribute.
        <li> <em>vector</em>: The name of the vector sent down with the query.
      </ul>
      Each unique string/integer in the weighted set corresponds to a dimension
      and the belonging weight is the vector component for that dimension.
      The query vector is set in the
      <a href="../reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.properties">rankproperty.dotProduct.<em>vector</em></a>
      query parameter, using syntax
      <code>{d1:c1,d2:c2,&hellip;}</code> where <em>d1</em> and <em>d2</em> are dimensions matching the strings/integers in
      the weighted set and <em>c1</em> and <em>c2</em> are the vector components (floating point numbers).
      The number of dimensions in the weighted set and the query vector do not need to be the same.
      When calculating the dot product we only use the dimensions present in both the weighted set and the
      query vector.
      </p><p>
      When using an array the dimensions is a positive integer starting at 0. If the query is sparse all non given dimensions
      are zero. That also goes for dimensions that outside of the array size in each document.
      </p><p>
      Assume a weighted set string attribute X with:
<pre>
"X": {
    "x": 10,
    "y": 20
}
</pre>
      for a particular document.
      The result of using the feature dotProduct(X,Y) with the query vector
      rankproperty.dotProduct.Y={x:2,y:4} will then be 100 (10*2+20*4) for this document.
      </p><p>
      Arrays can be passed down as <code>[w1 w2 w3 &hellip;]</code> or on sparse form <code>{d1:c1,d2:c2,&hellip;}</code>
      as is already supported for weighted sets.
      </p><p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When the query vector end up being the same as the query,
      it is better to annotate the query terms with weights
      (see <a href="simple-query-language-reference.html#term-weight">term weight</a>)
      and use the nativeDotProduct feature instead.
      This will run more efficiently and improve the correlation between
      results produced by the WAND operator and the final relevance score.
      </p><p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When using the dotProduct feature, <a href="../attributes.html#fast-search">fast-search</a> is not needed,
      unless also used for searching.
      When using the dotProduct query operator, use fast-search.

        Convenience function for generating token sequence input to Transformer models.
        Creates a tensor with dimensions <code>d0[1], d1[length]</code>, where
        <code>d0</code> is the batch dimension and <code>d1</code> is the maximum length
        of the token sequence. Assumes the inputs are zero-padded tensors representing
        token sequences. The result is the token sequence:
        </p>

        </ul>

        <p>
        The inputs are typically retrieved from the query, document attributes or constants.
        For instance, <code>tokenInputIds(128, query(my_input), attribute(my_field))</code>

        </ul>

        <p>
        will create a tensor of type <code>d0[1],d1[128]</code> consisting of the CLS token
        <code>101</code>, the tokens from the query, the SEP token <code>102</code>, the
        tokens from the document field, the SEP token <code>102</code>, and 0's for the
        rest of the tensor.
