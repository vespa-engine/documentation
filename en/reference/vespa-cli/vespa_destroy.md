## vespa destroy

Remove a deployed Vespa application and its data

### Synopsis

Remove a deployed Vespa application and its data.

This command removes the currently deployed application and permanently
deletes its data.

When run interactively, the command will prompt for confirmation before
removing the application. When run non-interactively, the command will refuse
to remove the application unless the --force option is given.

This command can only be used to remove non-production deployments. See
[https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/deleting-applications](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/deleting-applications) for how to remove
production deployments. This command can only be used for deployments to
Vespa Cloud, for other systems destroy an application by cleaning up
containers in use by the application, see e.g
https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/operations/multinode-HA#clean-up-after-testing
