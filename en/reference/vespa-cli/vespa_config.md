## vespa config

Manage persistent values for global flags

### Synopsis

Manage persistent values for global flags.

This command allows setting persistent values for global flags. On future
invocations the flag can then be omitted as it is read from the config file
instead.

Configuration is written to $HOME/.vespa by default. This path can be
overridden by setting the VESPA_CLI_HOME environment variable.

When setting an option locally, the configuration is written to .vespa in the
working directory, where that directory is assumed to be a Vespa application
directory. This allows you to have separate configuration options per
application.

Vespa CLI chooses the value for a given option in the following order, from
most to least preferred:

1. Flag value specified on the command line
2. Local config value
3. Global config value
4. Default value

The following global flags/options can be configured:

application

Specifies the application ID to manage. It has three parts, separated by
dots, with the third part being optional. If the part is omitted it defaults to
"default". This is only relevant for the "cloud" and "hosted" targets. See
[https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/tenant-apps-instances](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/tenant-apps-instances) for more details. This has no
default value. Examples: tenant1.app1, tenant1.app1.instance1

cluster

Specifies the container cluster to manage. If left empty (default) and the
application has only one container cluster, that cluster is chosen
automatically. When an application has multiple cluster this must be set a
valid cluster name, as specified in services.xml. See
[https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services-container.html](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services-container.html) for more details.

color

Controls how Vespa CLI uses colors. Setting this to "auto" (default) enables
colors if supported by the terminal, "never" completely disables colors and
"always" enables colors unilaterally.

instance

Specifies the instance of the application to manage. When specified, this takes
precedence over the instance specified as part of application. This has no
default value and is only relevant for the "cloud" and "hosted" targets.
Example: instance2

quiet

Suppress informational output. Errors are still printed.

target

Specifies the target to use for commands that interact with a Vespa platform,
e.g. vespa deploy or vespa query. Possible values are:

- local:  (default) Connect to a Vespa platform running at localhost. When using
          this target, container clusters are automatically discovered and are
          chosen with the cluster option. This assumes that the configserver is
          available on port 19071 (the default when using the Vespa container
          image).
- cloud:  Connect to Vespa Cloud. When using this target, container clusters are
          automatically discovered and can be selected with the cluster option.
- hosted: Connect to hosted Vespa (reserved for internal use)
- *url*:  Connect to a platform running at given URL. This instructs the command
          you're running to target a concrete URL. The cluster option cannot be
          used with this target.

Authentication is configured automatically for the cloud and hosted targets. To
set a custom private key and certificate, e.g. for use with a self-hosted Vespa
installation using mTLS, see the documentation of 'vespa cert'.

zone

Specifies a custom zone to use when connecting to a Vespa Cloud application.
This is only relevant for cloud and hosted targets and defaults to a dev zone.
See [https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/zones](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/zones) for available zones. Examples:
dev.aws-us-east-1c, dev.gcp-us-central1-f, perf.aws-us-east-1c

  -c, --color string         Whether to use colors in output. Must be "auto", "never", or "always" (default "auto")
  -i, --instance string      The instance of the application to use (cloud only)
  -q, --quiet                Print only errors
  -t, --target string        The target platform to use. Must be "local", "cloud", "hosted" or an URL (default "local")
