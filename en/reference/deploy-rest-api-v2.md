This is the API specification and some examples for the HTTP Deploy API that can be used to deploy an application:
* [upload](#create-session)
* [prepare](#prepare-session)
* [activate](#activate-session)

The response format is JSON. Examples are found in the [use-cases](#use-cases).
Also see the [deploy guide](../application-packages.html#deploy).

{% include note.html content='To build a multi-application system, use one or three config server(s) per application.
Best practise is using a [containerized](/en/operations-selfhosted/docker-containers.html) architecture,
also see [multinode-HA](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/operations/multinode-HA).' %}

The current API version is 2. The API port is 19071 - use
[vespa-model-inspect](/en/operations-selfhosted/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect) service configserver
to find config server hosts. Example:
`http://myconfigserver.mydomain.com:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session`.
Write operations return successfully after a majority of config servers have persisted
changes (e.g. 2 out of 3 config servers).

Entities:

| session-id | The session-id used in this API is generated by the server and is required for all operations after [creating](#create-session) a session. The session-id is valid if it is an active session, or it was created before [session lifetime](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/configdefinitions/src/vespa/configserver.def) has expired, the default value being 1 hour. |
| path | An application file path in a request URL or parameter refers to a relative path in the application package. A path ending with "/" refers to a directory. |

Use [Vespa CLI](../vespa-cli.html) to deploy from the command line.

{% include note.html content='Use [convergence](../application-packages.html#convergence)
to confirm configuration activation on all nodes.' %}

## POST /application/v2/tenant/default/prepareandactivate

Creates a new session with the application package that is included in the request,

## POST /application/v2/tenant/default/application/default/environment/default/region/default/instance/default/reindex

Marks specified document types in specified clusters of an application
as ready for [reindexing](../operations/reindexing.html).
Reindexing itself starts with the next redeployment of the application.
To stop an ongoing reindexing, see [updating reindexing](#update-reindexing) below.
All document types in all clusters are reindexed unless restricted, using parameters as specified:

| Parameters | | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | clusterId | A comma-separated list of content clusters to limit reindexing to. All clusters are reindexed if this is not present. | | documentType | A comma-separated list of document types to limit reindexing to. All document types are reindexed if this is not present. | | indexedOnly | Boolean: whether to mark reindexing ready only for document types with indexing mode *index* and at least one field with the indexing statement `index`. Default is `false`. | | speed | Number (0–10], default 1: Indexing pseudo speed - balance speed vs. resource use. Example: speed=0.1 | |
| Request body | N/A |
| Response | A human-readable message indicating what reindexing was marked as ready. |

Example:

`POST /application/v2/tenant/default/application/default/environment/default/region/default/instance/default/reindex?clusterId=foo,bar&documentType=moo,baz&indexedOnly=true`

```
{% highlight json %}
{
    "message": "Reindexing document types [moo, baz] in 'foo', [moo] in 'bar' of application default.default"
}
{% endhighlight %}
```

## PUT /application/v2/tenant/default/application/default/environment/default/region/default/instance/default/reindex

Modifies [reindexing](../operations/reindexing.html) of specified document types in
specified clusters of an application.
Specifically, this can be used to alter the pseudo-speed of the reindexing, optionally halting it by specifying
a speed of `0`; reindexing for the specified types will remain dormant until either speed is increased again,
or a new reindexing is triggered (see [trigger reindexing](#reindex)).
Speed changes become effective with the next redeployment of the application.
Reindexing for all document types in all clusters are affected if no other parameters are specified:

| Parameters | | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | clusterId | A comma-separated list of content clusters to limit the changes to. Reindexing for all clusters are modified if this is not present. | | documentType | A comma-separated list of document types to limit the changes to. Reindexing for all document types are modified if this is not present. | | indexedOnly | Boolean: whether to modify reindexing only for document types with indexing mode *index* and at least one field with the indexing statement `index`. Default is `false`. | | speed | Number [0–10], required: Indexing pseudo speed - balance speed vs. resource use. Example: speed=0.1 | |
| Request body | N/A |
| Response | A human-readable message indicating what reindexing was modified. |

Example:

`PUT /application/v2/tenant/default/application/default/environment/default/region/default/instance/default/reindex?clusterId=foo,bar&documentType=moo,baz&speed=0.618`

| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | BAD_REQUEST | Bad request. Client error. The error message should indicate the cause. |
| 400 | INVALID_APPLICATION_PACKAGE | There is an error in the application package. The error message should indicate the cause. |
| 400 | OUT_OF_CAPACITY | Not enough nodes available for the request to be fulfilled. |
| 401 |  | Not authorized. The error message should indicate the cause. |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND | Not found. E.g. when using a session-id that doesn't exist. |
| 405 | METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED | Method not implemented. E.g. using GET where only POST or PUT is allowed. |
| 409 | ACTIVATION_CONFLICT | Conflict, returned when activating an application fails due to a conflict with other changes to the same application (in another session). Client should retry. |
| 500 | INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR | Internal server error. Generic error. The error message should indicate the cause. |

## Use Cases

It is assumed that the tenant *default* is already created in these use cases,
and the application package is in *app*.

### Create, prepare and activate an application

Create a session with the application package:

```
$ (cd app && zip -r - .) | \
  curl -s --header Content-Type:application/zip --data-binary @- \
  "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session"
```

Prepare the application with the URL in the *prepared* link from the response:

```
$ curl -s -X PUT "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/1/prepared?applicationName=default"
```

Activate the application with the URL in the *activate* link from the response:

```
$ curl -s -X PUT "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/1/active"
```

### Modify the application package

Dump *services.xml* from session 1:

```
$ curl -s -X GET "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/1/content/services.xml"

Session 1 is activated and cannot be changed - create a new session based on the active session:

```
$ curl -s -X POST "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session?from=http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/application/default/environment/default/region/default/instance/default"
```

Modify rpcport to 12346 in *services.xml*, deploy the change:

```
$ curl -s -X PUT --data-binary @app/services.xml \
  "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/content/services.xml"
```

Get *services.xml* from session 2 to validate:

```
$ curl -s -X GET "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/content/services.xml"
```
```
{% highlight xml %}
xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?




                12346





{% endhighlight %}
```

To add the file *files/test1.txt*, first create the directory, then add the file:

```
$ curl -s -X PUT "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/content/files/"
$ curl -s -X PUT --data-binary @app/files/test1.txt \
  "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/content/files/test1.txt"
```

Prepare and activate the session:

```
$ curl -s -X PUT "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/prepared?applicationName=fooapp"
$ curl -s -X PUT "http://host:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/session/2/active"
```

### Rollback

If you need to roll back to a previous version of the application package
this can be achieved by creating a new session based on the previous known
working version by passing the corresponding session-id in the
*from* argument, see [creating a session](#create-session)

Also see [rollback](/en/application-packages.html#rollback).
