<p>
  Ranking, in general, becomes more accurate by using complex expressions which use many features.
</p><p>
  Read the <a href="query-api.html">query API</a> guide
  to get an overview of how queries are executed in Vespa, before continuing this guide.
</p><p>
  Vespa supports multiple rank phases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some <a href="#top-k-query-operators">specialized query operators</a>
      can do limited ranking to speed up retrieval of top matches by discarding
      low-quality matches early in the matching phase.
      </li>
  <li>Ranking at each content node in a
      <a href="#first-phase-ranking">first-phase expression</a>;
      configured by rank profiles with ranking expressions working
      on scalars, tensors or matching features, possibly also
      excluding low-quality matches.
      </li>
  <li>Re-ranking of the best hits at each content node using a
      <a href="#two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">second-phase ranking</a>
      (configured in rank profiles together with the first-phase expression).
      </li>
  <li>Re-ranking of the top hits from the content nodes in the stateless container
      using a configured expression (usually with an AI-trained ONNX model),
      see <a href="#global-phase">global-phase</a> below.
      </li>
  <li>For totally customized ranking it's possible to implement re-ranking of the top
      hits from the content nodes using a custom
      <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>.
      See concrete example in <a href="reranking-in-searcher.html">reranking in searcher</a>.
      </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-phase-ranking">Simple ranking on content nodes</h2>
<p>
  Normal ranking will always start by having one ranking expression
  that is evaluated on the content nodes.  This is configured in
  the <code>rank-profile</code> section of a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">schema</a>
  as a <code>first-phase</code> expression.  This expression can
  use various <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html">rank features</a>
  with information extracted during the matching phase to evaluate
  the quality of each hit.
  Because the first-phase is computed for every match, the cost is bounded
  only by the number of documents on each content node multiplied with
  the complexity of the first-phase expression; therefore the expression
  needs be simple and cheap to allow scaling to large amounts of documents.
</p>

<h2 id="two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">Two-phase ranking on content nodes</h2>
<p>
  While some use cases only require one (simple) <code>first-phase</code>
  ranking expression, for more advanced use cases it's possible to
  add another <code>second-phase</code> ranking expression in a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a>
  in the schema.
  This enables more expensive computations than would be feasible
  to run as a <code>first-phase</code> computation, with predictable
  upper bounds for the cost.  This phase runs only on the most
  promising hits as selected by the first-phase ranking, so it's
  important to have an appropriate first-phase, with good correlation
  between first-phase and second-phase expressions.
</p>
<p>
  By default, second-phase ranking (if specified) is run on the 100 best hits
  from the first-phase ranking per content node,
  after matching and before information is returned to the container.
  The number of hits to rerank can be configured as well in the rank-profile.
  Example:
</p>
<pre>
schema myapp {
    &hellip;
    rank-profile title-freshness inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression {
                nativeRank(title) + freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }
        second-phase {
            expression {
                xgboost("my-model.json")
            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, the first phase uses the text matching feature
  <a href="reference/nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> scoped to the <em>title</em> field
  plus one of the built-in document <a href="reference/rank-features.html">ranking features</a>
  named <em>freshness</em> over a <em>timestamp</em> field which stores the epoch time in second resolution.
  For each content node, the top 50 hits from the first phase function is re-ranked using
  a trained <a href="xgboost.html">xgboost</a> model.
</p>


<h2 id="global-phase">Using a global-phase expression</h2>
<p>
  Using a rank expressions configured as a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#globalphase-rank">global-phase</a>
  in the <code>rank-profile</code> section of a schema, you can add
  a ranking phase that will run in the stateless container after
  gathering the best hits from all content nodes; this can be used
  instead of or in addition to
  <a href="#two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">second-phase</a> ranking.
  The global-phase can also perform
  <a href="#cross-hit-normalization-in-global-phase">cross-hit normalization</a>
  to combine unrelated scoring methods.
</p>
<p id="globalphase-rerank-count">
  By default, global-phase ranking runs on the 100 globally best hits for
  a schema; this can be tuned in the rank-profile using
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#globalphase-rank">
    <code>rerank-count</code>
  </a>
  or per-query using the
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.globalphase.rerankcount">
    <code>ranking.globalPhase.rerankCount</code>
  </a>
  query property.
</p>
<p>
  This phase is optimized for running large ONNX models, taking
  some input data from the document and some from the query, and
  finding a score for how well they match. It's possibly to specify
  <em>gpu-device</em> to get GPU-accelerated computation of the
  model as well.  You can compute or re-shape the inputs to the
  ONNX model in a function if necessary, and use the output in some
  further calculation to compute the final score.
</p>
<p>
  Note that both input and output from ONNX models must always be
  some sort of tensor (in the simplest case with 1 dimension of
  fixed size 1) so at minimum the output tensor must be reduced to a
  simple number to get a ranking score.
</p>
<p>
  If you have large and complex expressions instead of an ONNX model,
  it's often better to use the highly optimized
  <a href="#two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">second-phase</a>
  computation on content nodes.  You can also force a sub-expression
  to be computed on the content nodes by making it a function and
  adding it as a <em>match-feature</em> in the ranking profile.
</p>

        field per_doc_vector type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[784]) {

            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }

}
</pre>

<h2 id="cross-hit-normalization-in-global-phase">Cross-hit normalization (including reciprocal rank fusion) in global-phase</h2>
<p>
  The ranking expressions configured for global-phase may perform
  cross-hit normalization of input rank features or functions.  This
  is designed to make it easy to combine unrelated scoring methods
  into one final relevance score.
  The syntax looks like a special pseudo-function call:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>normalize_linear(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>, <em>k</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank_fusion(<em>score_1</em>, <em>score_2</em> ...)</code> </li>
  </ul>
  The normalization will be performed across the hits that global-phase
  reranks (see <a href="#globalphase-rerank-count">configuration</a> above).
  This means that first, the input (<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)
  is computed or extracted from each hit that global-phase will
  rerank; then the normalization step is applied; afterwards when
  computing the actual global-phase expression the normalized output
  is used.
  As an example, assume some text fields with bm25 enabled, an onnx
  model (from the <a href="#myapp-with-global-model">example</a> in
  the previous section), and a "popularity" numeric attribute:
</p>
<pre>
    rank-profile with-normalizers inherits with-global-model {
        function my_bm25_sum {
            expression: bm25(title) + bm25(abstract)
        }
        function my_model_out {
            expression: sum(onnx(my_ranking_model).out)
        }
        global-phase {
            expression {
                normalize_linear(my_bm25_sum) + normalize_linear(my_model_out) + normalize_linear(attribute(popularity))
            }
            rerank-count: 200
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>normalize_linear</code> normalizer takes a single argument which must be
  a rank-feature or the name of a function.  It computes the maximum and minimum
  values of that input and scales linearly to the range [0, 1], basically using
  the formula <code>output = (input - min) / (max - min)</code>
</p>
<p>
  The <code>reciprocal_rank</code> normalizer takes one or two arguments; the first
  must be a rank-feature or the name of a function, while the second (if present)
  must be a numerical constant, called <code>k</code> with default value 60.0.
  It sorts the input values and finds their <em>rank</em> (so highest score gets
  rank 1, next highest 2, and so on). The output from reciprocal_rank is computed
  with the formula <code> output = 1.0 / (k + rank) </code> so note that even the best
  input only gets <code>1.0 / 61 = 0.016393</code> as output with the default k.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>reciprocal_rank_fusion</code> pseudo-function takes at least two arguments
  and expands to the sum of their <code>reciprocal_rank</code>; it's just a
  convenient way to write
  <pre class=code>
  reciprocal_rank(a) + reciprocal_rank(b) + reciprocal_rank(c) </pre>
  as
  <pre class=code>
  reciprocal_rank_fusion(a,b,c) </pre> for example.
</p>

<h2 id="stateless-re-ranking">Stateless re-ranking</h2>
<p>
  If the logic required is not suited for the <a href="#global-phase">global-phase</a> above,
  it's possible to write <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>
  which can re-rank hits using any custom scoring function or model.
  The searcher can also blend and re-order hits from multiple sources
  when using <a href="federation.html">federation</a> of content sources.

  See <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/msmarco-ranking/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/searcher/ReRankingSearcher.java">
  ReRankingSearcher</a> for inspiration.
  The linked searcher re-ranks the top global results from all content nodes using a Transformer (BERT) model.
</p><p>
  The searcher might request rank features calculated by the content nodes to be returned
  along with the hit fields using <a href="reference/inspecting-structured-data.html">summary-features</a>.
  The features returned can be configured in the <em>rank-profile</em>
  as <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
</p><p>
  The number of <em>hits</em> is limited by the query api
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#hits">hits</a> parameter and
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#queryprofile">maxHits</a> setting.
  The hits available for container level re-ranking are the global top ranking hits
  after content nodes have retrieved and ranked the hits
  and global top ranking hits have been found by merging the responses from the content nodes.
</p>





<h2 id="top-k-query-operators">Top-K Query Operators</h2>
<p>
  If the first-phase ranking function can be approximated as a simple linear function,
  and the query mode is <em>any</em>,
  the <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">Weak And/WAND</a> implementations in Vespa
  allows avoiding fully evaluating all the documents matching the query with the <em>first-phase</em> function.
  Instead, only the top K hits using the internal operator ranking will be exposed
  to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p><p>
  Both wand implementations accepts a targeted number of hits (top N).
  Each content node will expose all hits that were evaluated to the first-phase ranking function,
  while skipped documents will not.
  The skipped set are the ones that matches the query,
  but which cannot outperform any of the already collected hits on the internal scoring heap.
  Due to not fully evaluating all documents matching the query,
  the total hit count becomes inaccurate when using weakAnd/Wand.
</p><p>
  The <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> operator is also a top k retrieval operator which does ranking (by distance) and retrieval
  in one process and exposes only a small subset of the matching documents to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p>



<h2 id="choosing-phased-ranking-functions">Choosing phased ranking functions</h2>
<p>
A good ranking expression will for most applications consume too much CPU
to be runnable on the entire result set within the latency budget/SLA.
The application ranking function should hence in most cases be a second phase function.
The task then becomes to find a first phase function,
which correlates sufficiently well with the second phase function -
this to ensure that relevance is not hurt too much
by not evaluating the real ranking function on all the hits.
</p>



<h2 id="rank-phase-statistics">Rank phase statistics</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-features">match-features</a>
  and <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>
  to export detailed match- and rank-information per query.
  This requires post-processing and aggregation is an external system for analysis.
</p>
<p>
  To evaluate how well the document corpus matches the queries,
  use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#mutate">mutable attributes</a>
  to track how often each document survives each match- and ranking-phase.
  This is aggregated per document and makes it easy to analyse using the query and grouping APIs in Vespa -
  and no other processing/storage is required.
</p>
<p>
  A mutable attribute is a number where an operation can be executed in 4 phases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>on-match</li>
  <li>on-first-phase</li>
  <li>on-second-phase</li>
  <li>on-summary</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The common use case is to increase the value by 1 for each execution.
  With this, it is easy to evaluate the document's performance to the queries,
  e.g. find the documents that appear in most queries, or the ones that never matched -
  run a query and order by the mutable attribute.
</p>
{% include note.html content='The mutable attributes are just counters and memory-operations only -
the values might or might not not survive content node restarts.
The values cannot be compared across nodes.
Use the values to assess relative document matching and ranking performance since Vespa start' %}
<p>
  This example is based on the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quickstart</a>.
  It uses 4 attributes that each track how many times a document participates in any of the 4 phases.
  This is tracked only if using rank-profile <code>rank_albums_track</code> in the query:

            expression: sum(query(user_profile) * attribute(category_scores))
        }

</pre>
<pre>
$ vespa query \
  "select * from music where album contains 'head'" \
  "ranking=rank_albums_track"
</pre>


<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>
  The framework is flexible in use, the normal use case is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Reset the mutable attribute on all content nodes -
    use <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.searchpath">searchPath</a>
    to make sure all nodes are reset by sending a query using a rank profile that resets the value.
    For each phase, run a query that <em>matches</em> all documents, and reset the attribute - e.g.:
<pre>
$ for phase in match first_phase second_phase summary; do \
      for node in {0..3}; do vespa query \
          "select * from music where true" \
          "ranking=rank_albums_reset_on_$phase" \
          "model.searchPath=$node/0"; \
      done \
  done
</pre>
    Alternatively, run a query against a group
    and verify that <a href="reference/default-result-format.html">coverage</a> is 100%.
    <!-- ToDo: add note on what to do for the other mutable attributes -->
  </li>
  <li>
    Run query load, using the tracking rank-profile, like <code>rank_albums_track</code> above
  </li>
  <li>
    Run queries using <a href="reference/sorting.html">sorting</a> or <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a>
    on the mutable attributes.
  </li>
</ol>

{% include note.html content='Make sure that only the relevant query load uses the tracking rank profile.
E.g. exclude monitoring queries / automation by using a separate ranking profile.' %}

<p>
  To initialize a mutable attribute with a different value than 0 when a document is PUT, use:
</p>
<pre>
field match_count type long {
    indexing: 7 | to_long | attribute | summary   # Initialized to 7 for a new document. Default is 0.
    attribute: mutable
}
</pre>
<p>
  To dump values fast, from memory only (assuming the schema has an <code>id</code> field):
</p>
<pre>
document-summary rank_phase_statistics {
    summary id type int {}
    summary match_count type long {}
    summary first_phase_count type long {}
    summary second_phase_count type long {}
    summary summary_count type long {}
}
</pre>
<pre>
$ vespa query \
  "select * from music where true" \
  "presentation.summary=rank_phase_statistics"
</pre>
