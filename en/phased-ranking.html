title: "Phased Ranking"
---

<p>
Vespa allows expressing multiphased retrieval and ranking of documents. The retrieval phase is done close to the data in the content nodes,
while the ranking phase(s) can be done in the content nodes or in the stateless container after scatter-and-gather from content node(s).
The retrieval part of a phased pipeline is expressed by using the <a href="query-api.html">query API</a> 
and the ranking part is expressed by using the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a> in the schema.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong><a href="#top-k-query-operators"> <em>Top-k</em> query operators</a>, like <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">weakAnd/wand</a> and 
  <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> allow retrieval with sublinear complexity. These
  query operators use simple scoring functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate over Vespa indexes. Using
  the expressiveness of the Vespa query language, developers can combine multiple retrievers in the query, and expose 
  the union of retrieved documents into Vespa ranking phases.</li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Per node ranking:</strong>The query specification retrieves documents and ranks them using declarative phases evaluated within 
    the <a href="#two-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">content nodes</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#first-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">first-phase expression</a>;
      configured in <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a>. 
      This phase is evaluated for <em>all</em> hits retrieved by the query logic. This phase can also remove 
      retrieved documents using <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-score-drop-limit">rank-score-drop-limit</a>.
      </li>
      <li><a href="#two-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">second-phase ranking</a>;
      configured in <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a>.
      Optionally re-rank the top-scoring hits from the first-phase ranking using a more complex expression. The
      <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#secondphase-rerank-count">rerank-count</a> sets a strict upper bound on the 
      number of documents that are re-ranked.  
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Global ranking:</strong>Following the per content node local ranking phases, 
    re-ranking can occur after the content nodes have returned the merged top-scoring hits to the stateless container. 
    This phase is specified using a <a href="#using-a-global-phase-expression">global-phase</a> expression in the
    <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a>. 
    Additionally, the global-phase can conduct <a href="#cross-hit-normalization-including-reciprocal-rank-fusion">
      cross-hit normalization</a> to combine unrelated scoring methods.
  </li>
  <li>Finally, for customized ranking that is difficult to express in declarative phases, one can implement 
    re-ranking using <a href="reranking-in-searcher.html">reranking in searcher</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">First-phase ranking on content nodes</h2>
<p>
  Normally, you will always start by having one ranking expression
  that is evaluated on the content nodes.  This is configured in
  the <code>rank-profile</code> section of a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">schema</a>
  as a <code>first-phase</code> expression.  This expression can
  use various <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html">rank features</a>
  with information extracted during the matching phase to evaluate
  the relevance of each document. The first-phase expression
  is computed for every document retrieved by the query. The computational cost 
  is bounded by the number of documents exposed to the ranking phase on each content node multiplied with
  the complexity of the first-phase expression; therefore the expression
  needs to be simple and cheap to allow scaling to large amounts of retrieved docs. Alternatively,
  use retrieval operators that will expose only the top-k hits to the first-phase expression.
</p>



<h2 id="two-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">Two-phase ranking on content nodes</h2>
<p>
  While some use cases only require one (simple) first-phase
  ranking expression, for more advanced use cases it's possible to
  add a <code>second-phase</code> ranking expression in a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank-profile</a>
  in the schema.
  This enables more expensive computations than would be feasible
  to run as a first-phase computation, with predictable
  upper bounds for the cost.
</p>
<p>
  By default, second-phase ranking (if specified) is evaluated for the 100 best hits
  from the first-phase ranking per content node, tunable with 
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#secondphase-rerank-count">rerank-count</a>.
</p>
<pre>
schema myapp {
    &hellip;
    rank-profile title-freshness inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression {
                bm25(title) + 3*freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }
        second-phase {
            expression {
                xgboost("my-model.json")
            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, the first phase uses the text matching feature
  <a href="reference/bm25.html">bm25</a> scoped to the <em>title</em> field
  plus one of the built-in document <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank feature</a>
  named <em>freshness</em> over a <em>timestamp</em> field which stores the epoch time in second resolution.
  For each content node, the top 50 hits from the first phase function is re-ranked using
  a trained <a href="xgboost.html">xgboost</a> model.
</p>


<h2 id="using-a-global-phase-expression">Using a global-phase expression</h2>
<p>
  Using a rank expression configured as a
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#globalphase-rank">global-phase</a>
  in the <code>rank-profile</code> section of a schema, you can add
  a ranking phase that will run in the stateless container after
  gathering the best hits from the content node phases; this can be used
  instead of or in addition to
  <a href="#two-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">second-phase</a> ranking.
  The global-phase can also perform
  <a href="#cross-hit-normalization-including-reciprocal-rank-fusion">cross-hit normalization</a>
  to combine unrelated scoring methods.
</p>
<p id="globalphase-rerank-count">
  By default, global-phase ranking runs on the 100 globally best hits for
  a schema; this can be tuned in the rank-profile using
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#globalphase-rank">
    <code>rerank-count</code>
  </a>
  or per-query using the
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.globalphase.rerankcount">
    <code>ranking.globalPhase.rerankCount</code>
  </a>
  query property.
</p>
<p>
  This phase is optimized for inference with <a href="onnx.html">ONNX</a> models, taking
  some input data from the document and some from the query, and
  finding a score for how well they match. A typical use case is 
  re-ranking using <a href="cross-encoders.html">cross-encoders</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It's possible to specify <em>gpu-device</em> to get GPU-accelerated computation of the
  model as well. You can compute or re-shape the inputs to the
  ONNX model in a function if necessary, and use the output in some
  further calculation to compute the final score.
</p>
<p>
  If you have large and complex expressions (including <a href="xgboost.html">xgboost</a>, <a href="lightgbm.html">lightgbm</a>),
  instead of an ONNX model, it's more efficient to use the highly optimized
  <a href="#two-phase-ranking-on-content-nodes">second-phase</a>
  computation on content nodes. This is also true for sub-expressions that require lots of vector data, moving
  vector data across the network is expensive.
</p>
{% include note.html content='You can force a sub-expression
to be computed on the content nodes by making it a function and
adding it to match-features' %}
<p id="myapp-with-global-model">
By adding the feature to <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-features">match-features</a> in the ranking profile, the 
global-phase expression can re-use the function output without the complexity of transferring the data across the network
and performing inference in the stateless container (which is less optimized).
</p>
<pre>
schema myapp {
    document myapp {
        field per_doc_vector type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[784]) {
            indexing: attribute
        }
        &hellip;
    }
    &hellip;
    rank-profile with-global-model inherits default {
        inputs {
          query(per_query_vector) tensor&lt;float&gt;(d0[32])
        }
        first-phase {
            expression: bm25(title)
        }

        function my_expensive_function() {
            expression: # some expensive computation better done on content nodes
        }
        
        function per_doc_input() {
            # simple reshaping: ONNX input wants the dimension name "d0"
            expression: rename(attribute(per_doc_vector), x, d0)
        }
        onnx-model my_ranking_model {
            file: files/my_ranking_model.onnx
            input "model_input_1": per_doc_input
            input "model_input_2": query(per_query_vector)
            output "model_output_1": out
        }
        global-phase {
            expression {
                my_expensive_function + sum(onnx(my_ranking_model).out)
            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }
        match-featuresÂ {
            my_expensive_function
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  In the above example, the <em>my_expensive_function</em> will be evaluated on the content nodes
  for the 50 top-ranking documents from the first-phase so that the global-phase does not need to re-evaluate.
</p>



<h2 id="cross-hit-normalization-including-reciprocal-rank-fusion">Cross-hit normalization including reciprocal rank fusion</h2>
<p>
  The ranking expressions configured for global-phase may perform
  cross-hit normalization of input rank features or functions. This
  is designed to make it easy to combine unrelated scoring methods
  into one final relevance score.
  The syntax looks like a special pseudo-function call:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>normalize_linear(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank(<em>my_function_or_feature</em>, <em>k</em>)</code> </li>
    <li> <code>reciprocal_rank_fusion(<em>score_1</em>, <em>score_2</em> ...)</code> </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  The normalization will be performed across the hits that global-phase
  reranks (see <a href="#globalphase-rerank-count">configuration</a> above).
  This means that first, the input (<em>my_function_or_feature</em>)
  is computed or extracted from each hit that global-phase will
  rerank; then the normalization step is applied; afterwards, when
  computing the actual global-phase expression, the normalized output
  is used.
  As an example, assume some text fields with bm25 enabled, an ONNX
  model (from the <a href="#myapp-with-global-model">example</a> in
  the previous section), and a "popularity" numeric attribute:
</p>
<pre>
    rank-profile with-normalizers inherits with-global-model {
        function my_bm25_sum() {
            expression: bm25(title) + bm25(abstract)
        }
        function my_model_out() {
            expression: sum(onnx(my_ranking_model).out)
        }
        global-phase {
            expression {
                normalize_linear(my_bm25_sum) + normalize_linear(my_model_out) + normalize_linear(attribute(popularity))
            }
            rerank-count: 200
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>normalize_linear</code> normalizer takes a single argument, which must be
  a rank-feature or the name of a function.  It computes the maximum and minimum
  values of that input and scales linearly to the range [0, 1], basically using
  the formula <code>output = (input - min) / (max - min)</code>
</p>
<p>
  The <code>reciprocal_rank</code> normalizer takes one or two arguments; the first
  must be a rank-feature or the name of a function, while the second (if present)
  must be a numerical constant, called <code>k</code> with default value 60.0.
  It sorts the input values and finds their <em>rank</em> (so the highest score gets
  rank 1, next highest 2, and so on). The output from reciprocal_rank is computed
  with the formula <code> output = 1.0 / (k + rank) </code>, so note that even the best
  input only gets <code>1.0 / 61 = 0.016393</code> as output with the default k.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>reciprocal_rank_fusion</code> pseudo-function takes at least two arguments
  and expands to the sum of their <code>reciprocal_rank</code>; it's just a
  convenient way to write
</p>
<pre class=code>
reciprocal_rank(a) + reciprocal_rank(b) + reciprocal_rank(c)
</pre>
<p>as</p>
<pre class=code>
reciprocal_rank_fusion(a,b,c)
</pre>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>
  See the <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/colbert">Simple Hybrid Search with ColBERT</a>
  sample application for a practical example of using reciprocal rank fusion.
</p>


<h2 id="stateless-re-ranking">Stateless re-ranking</h2>
<p>
  If the logic required is not suited for the <a href="#using-a-global-phase-expression">global-phase</a> above,
  it's possible to write <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>
  which can re-rank hits using any custom scoring function or model.
  The searcher can also blend and re-order hits from multiple sources
  when using <a href="federation.html">federation</a> of content sources.
</p>
<p>
  The searcher might request rank features calculated by the content nodes to be returned
  along with the hit fields using <a href="reference/inspecting-structured-data.html">summary-features</a>.
  The features returned can be configured in the <em>rank-profile</em>
  as <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
</p><p>
  The number of <em>hits</em> is limited by the query api
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#hits">hits</a> parameter and
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#queryprofile">maxHits</a> setting.
  The hits available for container-level re-ranking are the global top-ranking hits
  after content nodes have retrieved and ranked the hits,
  and global top-ranking hits have been found by merging the responses from the content nodes.
</p>



<h2 id="top-k-query-operators">Top-K Query Operators</h2>
<p>
  If the first-phase ranking function can be approximated as a simple linear function,
  and the query mode is <em>weakAnd</em>,
  the <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">Weak And/WAND</a> implementations in Vespa
  allows avoiding fully evaluating all the documents matching the query with the <em>first-phase</em> function.
  Instead, only the top-K hits using the internal wand scoring are exposed
  to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking expression.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> operator is also a top-k 
  retrieval operator, and the two operators can be combined in the same query.
</p>



<h2 id="choosing-phased-ranking-functions">Choosing phased ranking functions</h2>
<p>
A good quality ranking expression will for most applications consume too much CPU
to be runnable on all retrieved or matched documents within the latency budget/SLA.
The application ranking function should hence in most cases be a second-phase function.
The task then becomes to find a first-phase function,
which correlates sufficiently well with the second-phase function.
</p>



<h2 id="rank-phase-statistics">Rank phase statistics</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-features">match-features</a>
  and <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>
  to export detailed match- and rank-information per query.
  This requires post-processing and aggregation in an external system for analysis.
</p>
<p>
  To evaluate how well the document corpus matches the queries,
  use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#mutate">mutable attributes</a>
  to track how often each document survives each match- and ranking-phase.
  This is aggregated per document and makes it easy to analyse using the query and grouping APIs in Vespa -
  and no other processing/storage is required.
</p>
<p>
  A mutable attribute is a number where an operation can be executed in 4 phases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>on-match</li>
  <li>on-first-phase</li>
  <li>on-second-phase</li>
  <li>on-summary</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The common use case is to increase the value by 1 for each execution.
  With this, it is easy to evaluate the document's performance to the queries,
  e.g. find the documents that appear in most queries, or the ones that never matched -
  run a query and order by the mutable attribute.
</p>
{% include note.html content='The mutable attributes are just counters and memory-operations only -
the values might or might not survive content node restarts.
The values cannot be compared across nodes.
Use the values to assess relative document matching and ranking performance since Vespa start' %}
<p>
  This example is based on the <a href="deploy-an-application-local.html">quickstart</a>.
  It uses 4 attributes that each track how many times a document participates in any of the 4 phases.
  This is tracked only if using rank-profile <code>rank_albums_track</code> in the query:

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>
  The framework is flexible in use; the normal use case is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Reset the mutable attribute on all content nodes -
    use <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.searchpath">searchPath</a>
    to make sure all nodes are reset by sending a query using a rank profile that resets the value.
    For each phase, run a query that <em>matches</em> all documents, and reset the attribute - e.g.:
<pre>
$ for phase in match first_phase second_phase summary; do \
      for node in {0..3}; do vespa query \
          "select * from music where true" \
          "ranking=rank_albums_reset_on_$phase" \
          "model.searchPath=$node/0"; \
      done \
  done
</pre>
    Alternatively, run a query against a group
    and verify that <a href="reference/default-result-format.html">coverage</a> is 100%.
    <!-- ToDo: add note on what to do for the other mutable attributes -->
  </li>
  <li>
    Run query load, using the tracking rank-profile, like <code>rank_albums_track</code> above
  </li>
  <li>
    Run queries using <a href="reference/sorting.html">sorting</a> or <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a>
    on the mutable attributes.
  </li>
</ol>

{% include note.html content='Make sure that only the relevant query load uses the tracking rank profile.
E.g. exclude monitoring queries / automation by using a separate ranking profile.' %}

<p>
  To initialize a mutable attribute with a different value than 0 when a document is PUT, use:
</p>
<pre>
field match_count type long {
    indexing: 7 | to_long | attribute | summary   # Initialized to 7 for a new document. The default is 0.
    attribute: mutable
}
</pre>
<p>
  To dump values fast, from memory only (assuming the schema has an <code>id</code> field):
</p>
<pre>
document-summary rank_phase_statistics {
    summary id {}
    summary match_count {}
    summary first_phase_count {}
    summary second_phase_count {}
    summary summary_count {}
}
</pre>
<pre>
$ vespa query \
  "select * from music where true" \
  "presentation.summary=rank_phase_statistics"
</pre>
