    This document contains HTTP/2 performance considerations on the container—see
    <a href="container-tuning.html">Container tuning</a> for general tuning of container clusters.
</p>

<h2>Enabling HTTP/2 on container</h2>
<p>
    HTTP/2 is enabled on a container for all connectors with TLS/HTTPS configured (requires Vespa 7.418.23 or newer).
    Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 will be served over the same connector using the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7301">TLS ALPN Extension</a>.
    The Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension allows the client to send a list of supported protocols during TLS handshake.
    The container selects a supported protocol from that list.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540">HTTP/2 specification</a> dictates multiple requirements for the TLS connection.
    Vespa may enforce some or all of these restrictions. See the HTTP/2 specification for the full list. The most significant are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client must use at least TLSv1.2.</li>
    <li>Client must provide target domain with the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) Extension.</li>
    <li>Client must not use any of the banned <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#appendix-A">TLSv1.2 ciphers</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feeding over HTTP/2</h2>
<p>
    One of the major improvements with HTTP/2 is multiplexing of multiple concurrent requests over a single TCP connection.
    This allows for high-throughput feeding through the <a href="../reference/document-v1-api-reference.html">Document v1 HTTP API</a>,
    with a simple one-operation–one-request model, but without the overhead of
    hundreds of parallel connections that HTTP/1.1 would require for sufficient concurrency.
    HTTP/2 + Document v1 is a great alternative to the <a href="../vespa-http-client.html">Vespa HTTP Client</a>,
    which implements a custom protocol, and requires a JDK 8+ client environment.
</p>
<p>
    Vespa provides a Java implementation of HTTP/2 + Document v1 in <a href="../vespa-feed-client.html">vespa-feed-client</a>.
    This client is available both as a Java API and a command line client.
</p>

<h2>Performance tuning</h2>
<h3>Client</h3>
<p>
    The number of multiple concurrent requests per connection is typically adjustable in HTTP/2 clients/libraries.
    Document v1 API is designed for high concurrency and can easily handle thousands of concurrent requests.
    Its implementation is asynchronous and max concurrency is not restricted by a thread pool size,
    so configure your client to allow enough concurrent requests/streams to saturate the feed container.
    Other APIs such as the <a href="../query-api.html">Query API</a> is backed by a synchronous implementation,
    and max concurrency is restricted by the <a href="container-tuning.html#container-worker-threads">underlying thread pool size</a>.
    Too many concurrent streams may result in the container rejecting requests with 503 responses.
</p>
<p>
    There are also still some reasons to use multiple TCP connections—even with HTTP/2:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Utilize multiple containers</strong>.
        A single container may not saturate the content layer.
        A client may have to use more connections than container nodes if the containers are behind a load balancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Higher throughput</strong>.
        Many clients allow only for a single thread to operate each connection.
        Multiple connections may be required for utilizing several CPU cores.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Client recommendations</h2>
<p>
    Use <a href="../vespa-feed-client.html">vespa-feed-client</a> for feeding through Document v1 API (JDK8+).
</p>
<p>
    We recommend the <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html">h2load benchmarking tool</a> for load testing.
    <a href="../reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-fbench">vespa-fbench</a> does not support HTTP/2 at the moment.
