<h2 id="attribute-vs-index">Attribute v.s index</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="../attributes.html">attribute</a> documentation summaries when to use
  <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#attribute">attribute</a>
  in the <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#indexing">indexing</a> statement.
  Also see the <a href="../operations/admin-procedures.html#schema-changes">procedure</a>
  for changing from attribute to index and vice-versa.
</p>
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing: summary | attribute
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
<p>
  If both index and attribute is configured for string type fields,
  Vespa will do search and matching against the index with default match <samp>text</samp>.
  All numeric type fields and tensor fields are attribute (in-memory) fields in Vespa.
</p>




<h2 id="when-to-use-fast-search">When to use fast-search for attribute fields</h2>
<p>
By default Vespa does not build any posting list index structures over <em>attribute</em> fields.
Adding <em>fast-search</em> to the attribute definition as shown below
will add an in-memory B-tree posting list structure
which enables faster search for some cases (but not all, see next paragraph):
<pre>
field timestamp type long {
    indexing:  summary | attribute
    attribute: fast-search
    rank:      filter
}
</pre>

<p>When Vespa executes a query with multiple query items it builds a query execution plan which it tries to 
optimize so that query tree items that are restrictive, meaning they match few documents, are evaluated early so 
that the temporary result set becomes as low as possible. 
To do so the query execution plan looks at hit count estimates for each part of the query tree using the index 
and B-tree dictionaries which track the number of documents a given term occurs in.
However, for attribute fields without fast-search there is no hit count estimate so the estimate becomes 
equal to the total number of documents (matches all) and is thus moved to the end of the query evaluation. 
A query with only one query term searching a attribute field without <em>fast-search</em> would be 
a linear scan over all documents and thus very slow:

<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100);
</pre>
But if this query term is <em>and</em>-ed with another term which matches fewer documents, that term will determine
the cost instead, and fast-search won't be necessary, for example:
<pre>
select * from sources * where range(timestamp, 0, 100) and uuid contains "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000";
</pre>
The general rules of thumb for when to use fast-search for an attribute field is:
<ul>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field is searched without any other query terms</li>
  <li>Use <em>fast-search</em> if the attribute field could limit the total number of hits efficiently</li>
</ul>
Changing fast-search aspect of the attribute is a
<a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#modifying-schemas">live change</a>
which does not require any re-feeding, so testing the performance with and without is low effort. 
Adding or removing <em>fast-search</em> requires restart.
</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-taat-daat">Hybrid TAAT and DAAT query evaluation</h2>
<p>
Vespa supports <strong>hybrid</strong> query evaluation over inverted indexes combining <em>TAAT</em> and <em>DAAT</em> evaluation to combine the best of both 
query evaluation techniques. Hybrid is not enabled per default and is triggered by a run time query parameter. 

<ul>
<li><b>TAAT</b> <em>Term At A Time</em> scores documents one query term at a time.  The entire posting iterator can be read per query term
and the score of a document is accumulated. It is cpu cache friendly as posting data is read sequentially without random seeking the posting list
iterator.
The downside is that <em>TAAT</em> limits
the term based ranking function to be a linear sum of term scores. This downside is one reason why most search engines uses <em>DAAT</em>.</li>
<li><b>DAAT</b> <em>Document At A Time</em> scores documents completely one at a time. This requires multiple seeks in the term posting lists which is 
 cpu cache unfriendly but allows non-linear ranking functions. </li>
</ul>

Generally Vespa does <em>DAAT</em> (document-at-a-time) query evaluation and not <em>TAAT</em> (term-at-a time) for the reason listed above. 

Ranking (score calculation) and matching (Does the document match the query logic) is not 
fully two separate disjunct phases where one first find matches and in a later phase calculates the ranking score.
Matching and <em>first-phase</em> score calculation is interleaved when using <em>DAAT</em>. 

<p>The <em>first-phase</em> ranking score is assigned to the hit when it satisfies the query constraints and 
at that point the term iterators are positioned at the document id and one can unpack additional data from the term posting lists, 
for example for term proximity scoring used by <a href="../nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> 
ranking feature which also requires unpacking of positions of the term within the document.</p>

<p>
The way hybrid evaluation is done is that <em>TAAT</em> is used for sub branches 
of the overall query tree which is not used for term based ranking. 

Using <em>TAAT</em> can speed up query matching significantly (up to 20-30%) in cases where the query tree is large and complex 
and where only parts of the query tree is used for term based ranking. Examples of branches that would require <em>DAAT</em> is using text ranking features 
like <a href="../reference/rank-features.html">bm25/nativeRank</a>. The list of ranking features which can handle <em>TAAT</em> is long but  
using <a href="../tensor-user-guide.html">attribute or tensor</a> features only can have the entire tree evaluated using <em>TAAT</em>.
</p>

<p>
For example, for a query where there is a user text query from an end user, one can use <em>userQuery()</em> YQL syntax 
and combine it with application level constraints.  The application level filter constraints in the query could benefit from
using <em>TAAT</em>. Given the following document schema:</p>

<pre>
search news {
  document news {
    field title type string {}
    field body type string{}
    field popularity type float {} 
    field market type string {
      rank:filter
    } 
    field language type string {
      rank:filter 
    } 
  }
  fieldset default {
    fields: title,body
  }
  rank-profile text-and-popularity {
    first-phase {
      expression: attribute(popularity) + log10(bm25(title)) + log10(bm25(body))
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
In this case the ranking profile only uses two ranking features, the popularity attribute and the <a href="../reference/bm25.html">bm25</a> score of the 
userQuery() terms against the default fieldset containing the title and body. Notice how market or language is not used in the ranking expression.</p>
<p>
In this query example there is a language constraint and a market constraint where both language and market is 
searched with a long list of valid values using OR, meaning that the document should match any of the market constraints and
any of the language constraints.</p>

<pre>
{
  'hits': 10,
  'ranking.profile': text-and-popularity",
  'yql': 'select * from sources * where userQuery() and \
   (language contains "en" or language contains "br") and \
   (market contains "us" or market contains "eu" or market contains "apac" or market contains ".." ... ..... ..);'
  'query': 'cat video'
}
</pre>

<p>
The language and the market constraints in the query tree are not used in the 
ranking score and that part of the query tree could be evaluated using <em>TAAT</em>. 

See also <a href="#multi-lookup-set-filtering">multi lookup set filter</a> 
for how to most efficiently search with large set filters where we want at least one of the constraints to match.

The sub-tree result is then passed as a bit vector into the <em>DAAT</em>
query evaluation which could speed up the overall evaluation. 
</p>

<p>Enabling hybrid <em>TAAT</em> is done by passing <b>ranking.matching.termwiselimit=0.01</b> as a request parameter.
 
One can evaluate if using the hybrid evaluation improves search performance by adding the above parameter. 
The limit is compared to the hit fraction estimate of the sub branch of the query tree, 
if the hit fraction estimate is higher than the limit the termwise evaluation is used to evaluate that sub-branch of the query.

<h2 id="indexing-uuids">Indexing uuids</h2>

<p>When configuring <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#type:string">string</a>
type fields with <samp>index</samp>,
the default <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#match">match</a> mode is <samp>text</samp>.
This means Vespa will <a href="../linguistics.html#tokenization">tokenize</a> the content and index the tokens.</p>

<p>The string representation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">
Universally unique identifier</a> (UUID) is 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits,
in five groups, separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12,
for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and four hyphens).</p>

<p>Example: Indexing <samp>123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000</samp> with the above document definition,
Vespa will tokenize this into 5 tokens: <samp>[123e4567,e89b,12d3,a456,426655440000]</samp>, 
each of which could be matched independently, leading to possible incorrect matches.</p>

<p>To avoid this, change the mode to <a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#word">match: word</a> to
treat the entire uuid as <i>one</i> token/word:
<pre>
field uuid type string {
    indexing: summary | index
    match:    word
    rank:     filter
}
</pre>
<p>
In addition, configure the <samp>uuid</samp> as a
<a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#filter">rank: filter</a> field -
the field will then be represented as efficient as possible during search and ranking.</p>

<p>The <samp>rank:filter</samp> behavior can also be triggered at query time on a per query item basis
by the <samp>com.yahoo.prelude.query.Item.setRanked()</samp>
in a <a href="../searcher-development.html">custom searcher</a>.</p>


<h2 id="parent-child-and-search-performance">Parent child and search performance</h2>
<p>
When searching imported attribute fields from parent document types
there is an additional cost penalty which can be reduced significantly
if the imported field is defined with <samp>rank:filter</samp>
and <a href="../reference/services-content.html#visibility-delay">visibility-delay</a> is configured to &gt; 0.
</p>


<h2 id="ranking-and-ml-model-inferences">Ranking and ML Model inferences</h2>
<p>
Vespa <a href="sizing-search.html">scales</a> with the number of hits the query retrieves per node/search thread,
and which needs to be evaluated by the first-phase ranking function.
Read more on <a href="../phased-ranking.html">phased ranking</a>.
Using phased ranking enables spending more resources during a second phase ranking step than in the first-phase.
The first-phase should be focused on getting decent recall (retrieve relevant documents in the top k),
while second phase is used to tune precision at k,
bringing the relevant documents to the top of the result set.
</p><p>
For <a href="../text-matching-ranking.html">text ranking</a> applications,
consider using the <a href="../using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND</a> query operator -
WAND can efficiently (sub-linear) find the top k documents using a inner scoring function. 
</p>


<h2 id="multi-lookup-set-filtering">Multi Lookup - Set filtering</h2>
<p>Several real world search use cases are built around limiting or filtering based on a set filter. If the contents of 
a field in the document matches any of the values in the query set it should be retrieved. 

For example searching data for a set of users:
<pre>
select * from sources * where user_id = 1 or user_id = 2 or user_id = 3 or user_id = 3 or user_id = 4 or user_id 5 .....;
</pre>

For OR filters over the same field it is strongly recommended to 
use the <a href="../reference/query-language-reference.html#weightedset">weighted set query operator</a>. It has considerably less
overhead than plain OR for set filtering. 

<pre>
select * from sources * where weightedSet(user_id, {"1":1, "2":1, "3":1});
</pre>

Attribute fields used like the above without other stronger search criteria should be created with <samp>fast-search</samp>. 

If there is a large number of unique values in the field 
it is faster to use <samp>hash</samp> dictionary instead of <samp>btree</samp> which is the 
default data structure for dictionaries for attribute fields with <samp>fast-search</samp>:

<pre>
field user_id type long {
  indexing: summary | attribute
  attribute:fast-search
  dictionary:hash
  rank:filter
}
</pre>
<p>
E.g if we have 10M unique user_ids in the dictionary and we search for 1000 users per query, <em>btree</em> dictionary would be 1000 lookup times log(10M), 
while hash based would be 1000 lookups times 1. 
The <em>weightedSet</em> query set filtering also work brilliantly in combination with <em>TAAT</em>, see <a href="#hybrid-taat-daat">hybrid TAAT/DAAT</a> section.  

Also see
<a href="../reference/schema-reference.html#dictionary">dictionary schema reference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="document-summaries-hits">Document summaries - hits</h2>
<p>
If queries request many hits from a cluster with few content nodes,
increasing the <a href="caches-in-vespa.html">summary cache</a> might reduce latency and cost.
</p><p>
Using <a href="../document-summaries.html">Explicit Document summaries</a>,
Vespa can support memory-only summary/hit fetching if fields referenced in document summary are <b>all</b> defined as <em>attribute</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="boolean-numeric-text-attribute">Boolean, numeric, text attribute</h2>
<p>
When selecting attribute field type, considering performance, this is a rule of thumb:
<ol>
  <li>Use boolean if a field is a boolean (max two values)</li>
  <li>Use a string attribute if there is a set of values - only unique strings are stored</li>
  <li>Use a numeric attribute for range searches</li>
  <li>Use a numeric attribute if the data is really numeric, don't replace numeric with string numeric</li>
</ol>
Refer to <a href="../attributes.html">attributes</a> for details.
