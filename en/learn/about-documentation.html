<p>The Vespa documentation (<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/">https://docs.vespa.ai/</a>) provides all the information required
to use all Vespa features and deploy them in any supported environment.</p>

<p>It is split into guides and tutorials, which explains features and how to use them to solve problems,
and reference documentation which list complete information about all features and APIs.</p>


<h2>Applicability</h2>

<p>The Vespa platform is open source, and can be deployed in self-managed systems and on the Vespa Cloud
service. Some add-ons (but no core functionality) are only available under a commercial license.</p>

<p>Documents that describe functionality with such limited applicability are clearly marked by one
or more of the following chips:</p>

<!-- Standard class="table" styling won't work due to the style settings in the chip includes -->
<table style="display: inline;">
  <tr><td>{% include chip-cloud.html %}</td><td style="white-space: normal; padding-top:18px">Only applicable to Vespa Cloud deployments.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>{% include chip-self-managed.html %}</td><td style="white-space: normal; padding-top:18px">Only applicable to self-managed deployments.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>{% include chip-enterprise.html %}</td><td style="white-space: normal; padding-top:18px">Not open source: Available commercially only (both self-managed and on cloud unless also marked by one of the other chips above).</td></tr>
</table>

<br/><br/>

<p>For clarity, any document <i>not</i> marked with any of these chips describes functionality that is
open source and available both on Vespa Cloud and self-managed deployments.</p>
