title: "Java Data Intensive Serving Container - JDisc"
---

<p>Vespa's Java container - JDisc, hosts all application components as well as the stateless logic of Vespa itself.
Which particular components are hosted by a container cluster is configured in services.xml. The main features of
JDIsc are:
<ul>
  <li>HTTP serving out of the box from an embedded Jetty server,
    and support for plugging in other transport mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Integration with the config system of Vespa which allows components to
    <a href="../configuring-components.html">receive up to date config</a>
    (by constructor injection) resulting from application deployment.</li>
  <li><a href="injecting-components.html">Dependency injection based on Guice</a>
    (Felix), but extended for configs and component collections.</li>
  <li>A component model based on <a href="developing-osgi-bundles.html">OSGi</a> which allows
  component to be (re)deployed to running servers, and to control which API's they expose to others.</li>
  <li>The features above combine to allow application package changes (changes to components, configuration or data)
    to be applied by Vespa without disrupting request serving nor requiring restarts.</li>
  <li>Standard component types exists for
    <ul>
    <li><a href="developing-request-handlers.html">general request handling</a>
    <li><a href="processing.html">chained request-response processing</a>
    <li><a href="../document-processing.html">processing document writes</a>
    <li><a href="../searcher-development.html">intercepting queries and results</a>
    <li><a href="../result-rendering.html">rendering responses</a>
    </ul>
    Application components can be of any other type as well and do not need to reference any Vespa API to
    be loaded and managed by the container.

  <li>A general <a href="../chained-components.html">chain composition</a> mechanism for components.</li>

    The JDisc container provides a framework for processing requests and responses,
    named <em>Processing</em> - its building blocks are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="../chained-components.html">Chains</a>
        of other components that are to be executed serially,
        with each providing some service or transform
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="processing.html">Processors</a>
        that change the request and / or the response. They may also
        make multiple forward requests, in series or parallel,
        or manufacture the response content themselves
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="processing.html#response-rendering">Renderers</a>
        that are used to serialize a Processor's response before
        returning it to a client
