<p>
  The config sentinel starts and stops services -
  and restart failed services unless they are manually stopped.
  All nodes in a Vespa system have at least these running processes:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Process</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead><tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><a href="operations/config-proxy.html">config-proxy</a></th>
      <td>
        proxies config requests between Vespa applications and the configserver node.
        All configuration is cached locally so that this node can maintain its current configuration,
        even if the configserver shuts down.
      </td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th style="white-space:nowrap;">config-sentinel</th>
      <td>
        registers itself with the <em>config-proxy</em>
        and subscribes to and enforces node configuration,
        meaning the configuration of what services should be run locally,
        and with what parameters.
      </td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th><a href="reference/logs.html#logd">vespa-logd</a></th>
      <td>
        monitors <em>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/vespa.log</em>, which is used by all other services,

<p>
  Start sequence:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>config server(s)</em> are started and application config is deployed to them -
    see <a href="operations/configuration-server.html">config server operations</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>config-proxy</em> is started.
    The environment variables <code><a href="reference/files-processes-and-ports.html#environment-variables">VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a></code>
    and <code><a href="reference/files-processes-and-ports.html#environment-variables">VESPA_CONFIGSERVER_RPC_PORT</a></code>
    are used to connect to the <a href="operations/configuration-server.html">config-server(s)</a>.
    It will retry all config servers in case some are down.
  </li><li>
    <em>config-sentinel</em> is started,
    and subscribes to node configuration (i.e. a service list) from <em>config-proxy</em>
    using its hostname as the <a href="contributing/configapi-dev.html#config-id">config id</a>.
    See <a href="operations/node-setup.html">Node and Network setup - Concepts and Requirements</a> for
    details about how the hostname is detected and how to override it.
    The config for the config-sentinel (the service list)
    lists the processes to be started, along with the <em>config id</em> to assign to each,
    typically the logical name of that service instance.
  </li><li>
    <em>config-proxy</em> subscribes to node configuration from <em>config-server</em>,
    caches it, and returns the result to <em>config-sentinel</em>
  </li><li>
    <em>config-sentinel</em> starts the services given in the node configuration,
    with the config id as argument -
    see example output below, like <em>id="search/qrservers/qrserver.0"</em>. Each service:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Subscribes to configuration from <em>config-proxy</em>.
      </li><li>
        <em>config-proxy</em> subscribes to configuration from <em>config-server</em>,
        caches it and returns result to the service.
      </li><li>
        The service runs according to its configuration,
        logging to <em>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/vespa.log</em>.
        The processes instantiate internal components,
        each assigned the same or another config id, and instantiating further components.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Also see <a href="#cluster-startup">cluster startup</a> for a minimum nodes-up start setting.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  When new config is deployed to <em>config-servers</em>
  they propagate the changed configuration to nodes subscribing to it.
  In turn, these nodes reconfigure themselves accordingly.
</p>



<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>
  The config sentinel runs an RPC service which can be used to list,
  start and stop the services supposed to run on that node.
  This can be useful for testing and debugging.
  Use <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-sentinel-cmd">vespa-sentinel-cmd</a> to trigger these actions.
  Example output from <code>vespa-sentinel-cmd list</code>:
</p>
<pre>
vespa-sentinel-cmd 'sentinel.ls' OK.
container state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=27993 exitstatus=0 id="default/container.0"
container-clustercontroller state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=27997 exitstatus=0 id="admin/cluster-controllers/0"
distributor state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=27996 exitstatus=0 id="search/distributor/0"
logd state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=5751 exitstatus=0 id="hosts/r6-3/logd"
logserver state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=27994 exitstatus=0 id="admin/logserver"
searchnode state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=27995 exitstatus=0 id="search/search/cluster.search/0"
slobrok state=RUNNING mode=AUTO pid=28000 exitstatus=0 id="admin/slobrok.0"
</pre>
<p>
  To learn more about the processes and services,
  see <a href="reference/files-processes-and-ports.html">files and processes</a>.
  Use <a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">
  vespa-model-inspect host <em>hostname</em></a> to list services running on a node.
</p>



<h2 id="cluster-startup">Cluster startup</h2>
<p>
  One can configure Vespa to do a <em>Safe Cluster Startup</em>,
  setting a minimum node available ratio.
  Use this to control the Vespa cluster start sequence.
  The config sentinel will not start services on a node unless it has connectivity to a minimum other nodes.
</p>
<p>
  The safe mode is disabled by default,
  enable it by setting configuration on top level in <em>services.xml</em> (since Vespa-7.415):
</p>
<pre>{% highlight xml %}
<services>
    <config name="cloud.config.sentinel">
        <connectivity>
            <minOkPercent>40</minOkPercent>
            <maxBadCount>1</maxBadCount>
        </connectivity>
    </config>
{% endhighlight %}</pre>
<p>
  Example: <code>minOkPercent 40</code> means that services will be started only if
  more than or equal to 40% of nodes are up.
  If there are 5 nodes (container + content nodes) in the application,
  the first node started will not start its services -
  when the second node is started, services will be started on both.
</p>
<p>
  <code>maxBadCount</code> is for connectivity checks where the other node is up,
  but we still do not have proper two-way connectivity.
  Normally, one-way connectivity means network configuration is broken and needs looking into,
  so this may be set low (1 or even 0 are the recommended values).  If there are some
  temporary problems (in the example below non-responding DNS which leads to various
  issues at startup) the config sentinel will loop and retry, so the service startup will just
  be slightly delayed.
